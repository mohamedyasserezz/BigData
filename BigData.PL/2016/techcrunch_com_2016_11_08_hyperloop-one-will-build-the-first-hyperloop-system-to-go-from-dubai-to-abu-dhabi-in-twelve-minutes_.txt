Hyperloop One will build the first Hyperloop system to go from Dubai to Abu Dhabi in twelve minutes

Hyperloop Oneand the United Arab Emirates are on the fast track to building out the first hyperloop system. Just today H1 announced it would build the first commercial hyperloop transportation system from Dubai to Abu Dhabi.

The journey is 99 miles (159.4 km) long and normally takes about two hours by car but H1 promises it would take a mere 12 minutes in the hyperloop.

H1 is partnering with the Dubai Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) to evaluate the feasibility of building this system in greater Dubai and the UAE and the announcement follows the next stage of development for the company, which is gearing up for its “Kitty Hawk” moment early next year when H1 will test a full-scale prototype of its system in the Nevada desert.

It’s also part of the company’s next stage of progress in Dubai. Last August H1 co-founder Shervin Pishevarhintedthe first hyperloop would be built overseas and the company announced in October it received$50 millionin funding from DP World Group of Dubai, the third-largest ports operator in the world, to build a hyperloop system to move cargo throughout the country and the world.

On top of the news, H1 revealed an original design concept for the portals and pods that would take passengers from Dubai to Abu Dhabi in H1’s autonomous transportation system.

Hyperloop One will work with McKinsey and architecture and engineering firm BIG to evaluate the concept of a build out for a passenger system in the UAE.
