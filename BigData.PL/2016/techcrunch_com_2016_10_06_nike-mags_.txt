Trying on Nike’s limited edition, self-lacing ‘Back to the Future’ shoes

Nike announced earlier this week that it will bereleasing a new edition of the Nike Mags,its self-lacing shoes inspired byBack to the Future— but only 89 pairs, which will beraffled off(tickets cost $10), with proceeds benefiting theMichael J. Fox Foundation‘s research on Parkinson’s disease.

I got a chance to (briefly) try on a pair of Mags and discuss the technology with Nike Senior Innovator Tiffany Beers. Even though the odds are that you won’t get to try out these shoes yourself, the technology is the same one poweringNike’s HyperAdapt shoes, which will be a widely available consumer product.

Beers talked about the long process of making self-lacing a reality — she said Nike designer Tinker Hatfield first asked her to look at the problem in 2005. She also explained why this could be more than just a cool novelty. (Though it is just undeniably cool to hear and feel the laces tightening around your feet.)

“Athletes can adjust these on-the-fly,” she said. “So time out in basketball, they can let bloodflow go back to the feet. Running performance, you know, if the shoe gets wet or if your foot’s swelling in a marathon, you can just change it.”
