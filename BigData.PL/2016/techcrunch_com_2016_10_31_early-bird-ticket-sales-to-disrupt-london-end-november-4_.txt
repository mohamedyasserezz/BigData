Early-bird ticket sales to Disrupt London end November 4

Planning on attending the best startup show in Europe? Disrupt London 2016 is just over a month away, but an important Disrupt deadline is later this week. You have just five more days to get discounted early bird tickets to Disrupt London for just £950, a full £250 less than they’ll be if you wait until Saturday, November 5.

You can get yourearly-bird tickets here.

That ticket nets you an all-access pass to TechCrunch Disrupt, where you can check out all the hot startups competing in the Startup Battlefield competition, trying to win the coveted Disrupt Cup, the $50,000 (about £40,600) grand prize and, perhaps most importantly, the attention of the tech community at large.

Plus, you’ll get to hear from our amazing lineup of entrepreneurs, innovators, and investors who will dish out their wisdom in the various interviews and lectures throughout the show, check out dozens of companies displaying their wares in the Startup Alley, and unwind after a long day on the show floor in the various after-parties that take place after the show floor closes up for the day.

Of course, you can’t do any of it if you don’t have a ticket, and the best way to get a ticket is to do it now before the price jumps by £250 on Saturday, November 5. You can get your discounted early-bird tickets to Disrupt London 2016here.

Disrupt takes place December 5-6 at London’s beautiful Copper Box Arena, and we can’t wait to see you all there.
