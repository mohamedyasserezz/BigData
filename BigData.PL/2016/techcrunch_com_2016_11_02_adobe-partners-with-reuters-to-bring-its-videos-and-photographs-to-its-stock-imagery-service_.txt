Adobe brings Reuters’ videos and photographs to its stock imagery service

Adobe today announced that it has partnered with Reuters to bring the news agency’s video and photography to itsAdobe Stockmarketplace.

Until now, Adobe Stock mostly focused on creative images and videos, but with this partnership, it is also adding editorial content. This includes Reuters photos that cover current news, sports and entertainment events. There are currently twelve million images in this archive and every day, Reuters will add thousands of images more.

As for videos, Adobe says it will now feature over a million news clips from Reuters in its library.

With this move, Adobe is clearly trying to challenge the likes of Getty, which also offer a similar mix of creative and editorial imagery.

In addition to the Reuters partnership, Adobe also today announced that it now features a couple of new asset types in its library. These include templates, lighting and materials (which work with the newly announced Project Felix), and fonts (as part of today’sTypekit update).

Adobe Stock now also features a new Visual Search service powered by Adobe’s machine learning smarts. This feature works similar to Google Images’ “Search by Image” feature in that you simply upload an image and Adobe Stock will try to find similar images in its library.
