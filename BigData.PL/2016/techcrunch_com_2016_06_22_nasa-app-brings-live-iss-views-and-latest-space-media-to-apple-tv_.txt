NASA app brings live ISS views and latest space media to Apple TV

Space fiends who are also couch potatoes, rejoice! NASA’s all-purpose app for finding and watching content from the cosmoshas arrived on Apple TV.

You could previously use it on any other iOS device, watching launches and press conferences live or getting the latest imagery from the International Space Station — but this lets you do so without even getting up to go find your phone.

“Now, users with the latest Apple TV can explore and enjoy our remarkable images, videos, mission information, NASA Television and more on the big screen with the whole family,” said NASA associate administrator for communications David Weaver in a press release. Sounds wholesome!

Mainly, though, this opens up the possibility of having your TV be a constantly on, live view from the ISS, which is probably the greatest thing any TV could possibly do.

Grab the app from the Apple TV app store — orhead here for links to other versions.
