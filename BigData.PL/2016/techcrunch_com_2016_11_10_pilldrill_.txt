PillDrill gets $3 million in funding for its medication tracking system

Announced earlier this year, the PillDrill is a simple system designed to take some of the pain out of remembering to take medication – taking things between those big plastic pill boxes with the help of a little 21stcentury connectivity.

The system is built around the Pill Drill Hub, which offers up an audio/visual reminder when the time comes to take a dose. Once the pills are taken and a barcode is waved in front of the scanner, the WiFi connected system sends updates to friends and family members, keeping them abreast of the user’s daily dosage.

The Las Vegas company, which launched the system back in April has closed a $3 million round of angel investor funding, courtesy of undisclosed parties. The money is set to go toward distribution for the $200 at-home medication device.

PillDrill is also using the occasion to announce that it’s scored an innovation award at next year’s CES and added retired MedVenture Associates founder Annette Campbell-White to its board of directors.
