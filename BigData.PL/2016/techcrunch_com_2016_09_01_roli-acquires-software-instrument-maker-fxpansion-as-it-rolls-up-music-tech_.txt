ROLI acquires software instrument maker FXpansion as it rolls-up music tech

ROLI, which makes the Seaboard (new type of keyboard musical instrument), has acquiredFXpansion, a maker of software instruments, for an undisclosed sum.

London-based FXpansion already makes sounds and effects for ROLI’s growing collection of hardware and software products. FXpansion’s virtual instruments include the BFD3, the world’s largest collection of acoustic drum sounds, and Strobe2, the analogue-modeled software synthesizer.

As well as the Seaboard, ROLI has developed Equator, the software synthesizer; NOISE, the free app that turns iPhones into musical instruments; Blend, the social platform for music collaboration; and JUCE, the C++ coding framework for audio developers.

The acquisition follows ROLI’s$27 million Series B fundraising— led by U.S.-basedFoundry Group— in May 2016.

ROLI appears to be using its war chest to literally roll-up software and hardware in the music space, which has remained largely unchanged for years.
