Netflix gets ‘The People v. O.J. Simpson’ in 2017

Netflix has signed its first global licensing deal for streaming video rightswith 20th Century Fox, and viewers are in luck because the first show coming to Netflix exclusively for streaming isAmerican Crime Story. Netflix will be the place to watch season one of the FX show starting in 2017, and for those who haven’t been keeping up with the cultural pulse, that meansThe People v. O.J Simpsonmini-series becomes available to Netflix viewers globally – unless you’re in Canada, the one cold, desolate locale left out of this deal.

The Cuba Gooding Jr.-starrer (which also features John Travolta and David Schwimmer earning critical accolades for the first time in years, if not decades) chronicles the tale of the O.J. Simpson double murder trial, spanning 10 episodes. The O.J. Simpson trial took place in 1195, and basically captured the attention of the entire nation.

Netflix signing Fox up for American Crime Story bodes well for fans of other series distributed by the broadcast giant, since hopefully it paves the way for other streaming arrangements. For now, though, anyone who’s been holding out on the O.J. miniseries should block off some time in 2017 for a decent stretch of binge-watching.
