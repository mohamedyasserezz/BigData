GeoCV captures your apartment in vivid 3D

Apartment walk-throughs are necessary but uneventful. You visit the kitchen, hit the bathroom, size up the bedroom, kick a dead cockroach into the front closet and then sign a contract. But what if you could see an apartment in 3D even before you visited the building. That’s whatGeoCVis trying to do.

The system consists of a mobile app for 3D scanning and a cloud processor for creating the 3D model. The model then is visible in SketchFab 3D viewing software and can be viewed using Google Cardboard or other VR systems.

The founders, Anton Yakubenko and Gleb Krivovyaz, have PhDs from the Graphics & Media Lab at Moscow State University. They worked on a number of research products before deciding to bring true 3D to market. They are part of theStarta Acceleratorin New York.

The company has raised $700,000 from four investors, including Rothenberg Ventures. They will be launching next year with a usable product, but until then you can fly around a virtual apartment on their website and click the various labels — bedroom, foyer, kitchen — for a closer look at the walls, carpets and potential spots for hiding dead cockroaches.
