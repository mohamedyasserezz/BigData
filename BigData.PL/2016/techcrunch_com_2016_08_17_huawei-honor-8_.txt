Huawei’s premium $400 Honor 8 is now up for pre-order in the States

It’s still a ways from being a household name here in the States, but Huawei is starting to turn heads by offering some premium level specs for a (relative) song. The contrast is particularly clear a day after reviews for Samsung’s $800+ Note 7 went live.

TheHonor 8cuts that unlocked pricing more than in half, while managing not to skimp on the specs. At the center of the device is a 5.2-inch 1,920 x 1 ,080 display, which works out to dense 423ppi. There’s an octa-core processor, 32GB of storage (expandable via MicroSD slot), 4GB of RAM and a 3,000mAh battery inside.

There are some innovative features on board, as well, including, most notably, a 12-megapixel dual-camera on the back that combines to create an improved composite image, while the company’s EMUI software augments Android 6.0 with bonuses like knuckle-based screen capture.

All of that’s encased in an eye-catching (and ridiculously glossy) design, available now for pre-order starting at $400. The company’s also tossing in a $50 rebate through its site if you get in before September 3rd, making the offer all the more tempting.
