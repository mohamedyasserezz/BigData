Just because you can play Doom on the MacBook Pro Touch Bar doesn’t mean you should

“Does it run Doom?” has long been the gold standard of getting stuff to play on other stuff that it probably shouldn’t be played on. The answer is almost invariably “yes.” The longer answer is usually more along the lines of “yes, but why would you want to?”

That certainly applies here. Sure you could play the classic first-person-shooter on that lovely 2560 x 1600/ 2880 x 1800 display, but where’s the fun in that, when there’s another Retina Display going unused? TheTouch Barhas a decidedly lopsided 2170 x 60 resolution, making it the perfect candidate for the latest unofficial port.

Side note, as ridiculous (ly amazing) as Doom is running on the Touch Bar is… the HUD is equally greatpic.twitter.com/RFwq7nJ7ae

Facebook engineer Adam Belltook up the challenge, and the results are about as distorted as one would expect – but it’s doable, and that’s the important thing at the end of the day. Bell also used the Touch Bar for the game’s HUD, which makes for a much more aesthetically (if impractical) use of the skinny strip of real estate between the display and keyboard.

Apple’s likely not in love with such unauthorized uses of its shiny new technology, but I suspect we’re likely to some of the most innovative Touch Bar uses arriving from outside the company’s official vetting process. See also the more resolutionarily appropriateNyan Cat.
