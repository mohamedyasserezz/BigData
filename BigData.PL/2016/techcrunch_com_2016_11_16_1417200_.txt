DJI’s Inspire 2 is inspirational

On Tuesday at an exclusive invite-only event on a lot at Warner Brothers studios in Burbank , Calif. DJI announced its two newest drones: the Phantom 4 Pro and the Inspire 2.

Clearly, DJI seems most excited about the new features on the Inspire 2, showing the drone’s capabilities for professional filmmaking off in a behind the scenes demo for industry insiders that saw the company create a short film on-site using only the Inspire 2 for all of its camera work.

The drone, The Inspire 2 will run $2,999. There’s also a combo pack, including the aforementioned Zenmuse X5S camera, among other things — that will run considerably more at $6,198.

That premium combo is set to start shipping next month, while the standalone aircraft and camera will arrive in January.
