Tascam debuts a pair of small soundboards for podcasters

The name “MiniStudio” should give you a pretty clear idea of what you’re in for withTascam’s new offerings. The two devices are essentially little boards designed to recreate a radio studio on a small scale at home for podcasting purposes.

Both boards are Windows and Mac compatible, connecting to a computer (and powering) via USB, and using the Apple Camera Kit, it’s also possible to hook them up to iOS devices. They’re capable of recording audio quality up to 24-bit, 96 kHz and work with various software solutions.

Both also feature three illuminating PON pads to trigger sound effects, so you can get your morning Zoo Crew style recording on (airhorns and fart sounds anyone?), along with a built-in voice effect feature. All of that can be monitored in real-time via the MiniStudio’s Broadcast mode.

The MiNiSTUDIO Creator US-42 builds upon the MiNiSTUDIO Personal US-32 with a second mic input for guests, multiple headphones jacks and an RCA output for studio monitors. The 42 also features a Creator mode designed for editing audio.

The boards are available now for $130 and $180, respectively.
