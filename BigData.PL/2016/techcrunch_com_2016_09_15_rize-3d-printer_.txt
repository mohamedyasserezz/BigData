Boston-basedRize Inchas developed a new type of 3D printing which eliminates the need for lengthy post-printing clean-up processes.

Using a patented technology the company callsAugmented Polymer Deposition, its printers are able to imbue plastics with features they didn’t usually have. For example, it will be easier to remove 3D printed products from the build surface, it’s possible to inject dyes into the product to create parts with patterns, variable hardness and other superpowers.

“We’ve developed a technology that enables 3D printed parts to have qualities that wouldn’t otherwise be possible,” Julie Reece, the company’s VP of Marketing explains. “This means that a single 3D printed part can have different qualities. It would be possible to print a running shoe, for example.”

The company is currently in beta, but has a beefy* product roadmap and is planning on rolling out its various technologies and functional dyes over the next few years. It is currently raising a $5m Series A to wrap up its beta program and bring its next-gen 3D printers to market.
