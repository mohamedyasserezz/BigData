ZTE’s Axon 7 gets a variant with improved specs and Force Touch

Tis the season for spec upgrades. It’s the next best thing to issuing a full-on product refresh in the lead up to the holidays. Unlike the recently issued OnePlus 3T, however, the new Axon 7 6+128 won’t be replacing its namesake, instead it will just slot in alongside the handset (and the not-mini Axon 7 Mini) at, naturally, a higher price point.

Even still, $500 isn’t too shabby when you consider what you’re getting here. The 7 6+128 build on the 7’s already solid specs, including a 1440 x 2560 5.5 inch display, Snapdragon 820 processor and 20-megapixel camera, while adding 6GB RAM and 128GB of storage to the on-board specs. That’s upgraded from an already solid 4 and 64GB, respectively.

Also new is the unfortunately named Force Touch, a pressure sensitive functionality that sounds like it’s fairly similar to Apple’s 3D Touch offering. The handset runs $100 more than the standard Axon 7 and $200 more than the Mini. It’s available now in the USthrough ZTE’s site, though apparently in “limited quantities.”
