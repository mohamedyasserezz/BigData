Announcing the TechCrunch Disrupt London 2016 Agenda

TechCrunch Disrupt Londonreturns to London in just a few weeks and we’re excited to reveal the agenda. We have an incredible lineup with global product launches, incredible speakers, engaging demos and the clash of ideas about the future of Europe.

The two-day conference (preceded by a two-dayHackathon, grab tickets here), kicks off on December 5 in the former Olympic Village’s Copper Box Arena, and wraps the following day with the Startup Battlefield finals where one startup will take home £30,000 in cash.

Deep learning legend Dr. Michael Lynch will talk about the future of AI and investing. The founder of hot London startupCitymapper, Azmat Yusuf, will discuss what is on the horizon for his company. For starters, you may have seen robots wandering around in the U.S. Marc Raibert, CEO and Founder ofBoston Dynamics, is flying in from the States to show off his company’s latest walking robots. And there’s Amy Chang of Accompany, Jay Hoag of TCV and the founders ofMusical.lymaking the trip across the pond, too.

There will be no shortage of discussion about Brexit’s impact on the European tech scene. Balderton’s James Wise will release their talent study for the first time on our stage. He will be joined by Martha Lane Fox (Doteveryone) and Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP (Minister of State responsible for digital policy at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport) to discuss the impact of Brexit on startups and the ecosystem as a whole. Dr. Jackie Hunter ofBenevolentBiowill discuss the crossroads of biotech and AI and Samantha Payne ofOpen Bionicswill demo new products for the first time on our stage.

Startups are also welcome to exhibit at the show. There are still several booths available in Startup Alley.

For the first time we’re bringing our CrunchMatch program to Disrupt London where we match startups to investors for private meetings. The details arehere.

And to top it off we have 15 amazing startups in Startup Battlefield who will compete to win the coveted Disrupt Cup.
