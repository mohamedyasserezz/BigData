LoveBot tells your wife you love her so you don’t have to

LoveBot is the thoughtful husband or wife that you aren’t.

Presenting at the 2016 TechCrunch Disrupt SF Hackathon,Guru Ranganathanwas sure to specify once he got onstage that his LoveBot doesn’t do what you probably think it does.

Instead of making robot love, this chatbot speaks the love language by sending messages to designated contacts telling them how much you love and appreciate them or asking them how their day is going.

The app which uses the Telegram App SDK has multiple message setting types, including love, casual and motivational.

Lovewill send your loved one sweet, sweet Shakespeare quotes or messages that can bring that missing spark back into your relationship.Casualsends a check-in to your friend or lover to see how they’re doing or what they’re up to. Motivational is a bit strange. It sends your contact a quote that will maybe sorta inspire them. You can also set the frequency of these messages within the app’s portal.

Guru Ranganathan and Karthikeyan Santana, both employees at Microsoft, created the app because they thought it was a funny idea, but they suggested that the app had potential beyond expressing love. With access to your contacts or Facebook friend list, Ranganathan suggested that the app could help you check in on old buddies and rekindle friendships.

“Sending the first message in a conversation is always the hardest,” said Ranganathan.
