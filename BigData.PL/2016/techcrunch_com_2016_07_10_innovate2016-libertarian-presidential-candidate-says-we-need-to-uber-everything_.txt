Given the unprecedented unpopularity of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, 2016 could well be the year of the third party candidate.

Whatever one thinks of his ideology,Libertarian PartycandidateGary Johnsonmay be the pro innovation candidate that Silicon Valley has been waiting for.

We need “to Uber everything” Johnson tells INNOVATE2016 guest interviewerCALinnovates’ Kish Rajan.

The sharing economy, he believes, is the “model of the future” and should be encouraged, rather than regulated against. It’s “so short-sighted” of local authorities, he insists, citing his problems in trying to rent his own property, to outlaw Airbnb. If I’m President, the 2016 Presidential candidate promises, “we’ll stop with the restriction.”

Johnson may also be more in sync with Silicon Valley on both surveillance and immigration. The mass collection by the government of our personal data, he argues, has been pointless. He is equally outspoken on immigration, saying that “we are a country of immigrants” and we should “embrace immigration” by getting government out of the business of establishing quotas.

So no walls for Gary Johnson. It’s going to be interesting to see how this radical pro innovation message plays out in 2016.
