Vault-Tec Workshop gives Fallout 4 players their own Vault to toy with

Fallout 4, I can’t quit you. At least, not while Bethesda continues adding content, like today’s launch of theVault-Tec Workshopadd-on. The $4.99 DLC brings players on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC the ability to create their own Values, stock it with furniture and fill it with residents to mislead and mistreat.

For those unfamiliar with the series, Vaults in Fallout are hamster-tunnel like underground dwellings which were ostensibly designed to protect members of the population during nuclear apocalypse, but which it turns out Vault-Tec was using to run a series of nefarious experiments.

You’ve been able to create Vaults in the Fallout virtual world previously, but only in Fallout Shelter, the mobile-first spin out game (which is now available on PC, too, by the way). Now, though, you can do it in Fallout 4’s rich graphical world. It also comes with some new quests, which is not something typically included in Workshop-style add-ons for the game that focus on crafting.

There are plenty of new structure types, furniture items, signs, decorations and more to bring your Vault to life, so you have quite the extended palette to work with.
