Gillmor Gang: Bait and Switch

The Gillmor Gang â€” Robert Scoble, Keith Teare, Kevin Marks, and Steve Gillmor. Recorded live Saturday, October 1, 2016. The Gang announces its version of the Alexa Prize, TrumpBot: an undisclosed amount of virtual tax breaks to the first person to create a chatbot that speaks intelligently for 20 seconds. Believe me, it will be great.
