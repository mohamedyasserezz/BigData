Facebook suddenly says a bunch of its users are dead. Don’t panic.

Over the last half hour or so, reports have started pouring in from Facebook users that the social network has suddenly “memorialized” their pages, strongly suggesting that they are dead to everyone who stops by.

Take the above profile of our own Darrell Etherington — who is very much not dead, as in I’m talking to him right now and I’m definitely not Bruce Willis.

“We hope people who love Darrell will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate his life” it reads.

The issue seems to be fairly random; it’s not popping up on everyone’s profile, but it’s certainly happening on a lot of them, including Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.

Probablynot the best time to get something like this wrong, Facebook.

We’ve reached out to Facebook to figure out wtf is happening.

Update:In a quote from a Facebook rep, the company says they’ve fixed it and they’re sorry.

“For a brief period today, a message meant for memorialized profiles was mistakenly posted to other accounts. This was a terrible error that we have now fixed. We are very sorry that this happened and we worked as quickly as possible to fix it.”
