Video distribution startup Zype raises $2M

Zypehas raised another $2 million as it helps publishers deliver (and make money from) video across devices.

Added tothe $1.6 millionthat Zype announced last year, this brings the New York City startup’s seed round to $3.6 million. The round was led by Revel Partners, with participation from Point Nine Capital, Alpine Meridian Ventures, Berlin Ventures, Entrepreneurs Investment Fund and Terrapin Bale Ventures.

Zype’s platform can be used to build video websites and apps for mobile devices and set-top boxes. It incorporates technology that will automatically select the best video player (including Zype’s own player) for each device and geography, and it also offers support for monetization through advertising, video purchases and rentals.

Founder and CEO Ed Laczynski said that with Zype, publishers “don’t have to give up audience data and ownership — they can have complete control of their revenue stream.”

Asked how the media industry’s growing dependence on Facebook affects Zype’s work with websites and apps, Laczynski argued, “Social media is amazing for promotion, discovery and short form.” However, when it comes to longer, more in-depth videos, “Smart content owners are leveraging those platforms to drive traffic to their owned properties.”

The company says that over the past 12 months, it has seen its revenue grow by more than 40 percent each quarter. Laczynski said he’s also become increasingly focused on larger enterprise customers, with current clients including Mill Creek Entertainment, What’s Trending and conservative Canadian company The Rebel Media.

Upcoming projects include Zype University, a program for training the company’s customers on how to best build a successful business around online video.
