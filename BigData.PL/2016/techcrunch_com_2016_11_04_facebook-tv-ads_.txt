Facebook will test ads on Apple TV and Roku

Facebook’s ad ambitions are expanding to encompass Internet-connected TVs — it will be conducting a test of its ad network on Apple TV and Roku next week.

Other online ad companies (including TechCrunch-owner AOL) have explored TV advertising already. In Facebook’s case, the company will use Facebook data to target ads for A+E and Tubi TV — basically, what the Facebook Audience Network already does for websites and mobile apps.

It sounds like this really is just a limited test. They will be US-only, and will not involve real ad campaigns, but rather house ads and public service announcements.

The news wasfirst reported in Recode. A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the news and sent us the following statement:

We are testing how to best deliver video ads through Audience Network to people watching content on connected TVs. Our goal is to bring relevant ad experiences to people both on Facebook and off.
