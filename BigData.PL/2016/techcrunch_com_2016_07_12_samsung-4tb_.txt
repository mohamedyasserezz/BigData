Samsung’s new 4TB SSD costs about as much as a MacBook Pro

For those in need of substantial PC storage, spinning hard drives are still very much a reality. That’s changing, of course, though not quite as quickly as many upgraders are hoping. $700 will get you a 2TB solid state hard drive from the friendly folks at Samsung, and now you can double that storage at more than double the price.

The company’s been offering up server-ready drives with quadruple the capacity for a bit, and now it’s finally ready to bring 4TB of SATA SSD storage to the desktop. Users with a whole lot to store and not a lot of room to store it can now pick up the 4TB 850 EVO 2.5-inch hard drive for a cool $1,500through Amazon.

The storage system tops out at 540MB/s read and 520MB/s write speeds, which is inline with the performance of the company’s other capacities, running the gamut from a measly 120GB on up.
