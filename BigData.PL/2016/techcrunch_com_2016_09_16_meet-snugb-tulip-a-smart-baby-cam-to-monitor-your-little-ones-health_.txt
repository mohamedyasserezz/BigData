Meet Snugb Tulip, a smart baby cam to monitor your little one’s health

Tulip, a cute little gumdrop-shaped baby monitor fromSnugbis outfitted with a versatile camera that gathers data on room temperature, humidity and air quality around your baby’s crib.

The camera can move in multiple directions for wherever your wee one has crawled and the device comes equipped with a wireless pulse oximetry sensor to capture data on your baby’s heart rate and blood oxygen levels — both important factors in monitoring and preventing Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

Snugb’s Tulip is just a prototype for now, but it’s part of a new crop of parent tech helping those with kids ensure safety and security for their family such asOwlet, a baby sock and health monitor orMimo, a washable cotton onesie with breathing sensors developed to check baby’s vital signs.

The Snugb device comes with an app for easy monitoring in the next room and we’re told it will soon have a Kickstarter campaign for those interested in supporting the manufacturing process.

We caught up Snugb founder Adam Rivera while he was in Startup Alley for the third day of TechCrunch Disrupt SF this past week. Check out the video above to find out more and see Snugb in action.
