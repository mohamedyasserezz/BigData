Pizza Hut is giving you more than just grease in your next pizza box: The maker of fine savory Italian pies has created a playable DJ interface out of cardboard using partner Novalia’s printable electronics tech. And so I must retire, and become the greatest pizza-based DJ the world has ever seen.

My beats are delicious and unexpected, like jalapeño with pineapple. Currently booking six months out, get in touch.
