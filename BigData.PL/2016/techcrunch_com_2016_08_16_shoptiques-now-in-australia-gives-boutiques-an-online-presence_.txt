Shoptiques, now in Australia, gives boutiques an online presence

Shoptiques has been making big moves of late, opening up business in Australia and the Netherlands and updating their app and website.

But perhaps more interesting is that Shoptiques has revealed how the platform has transformed the boutique shopping industry as a whole. The company says that retailers that are using the platform see sales growth increase 157 percent month over month in their first two months on the platform.

The startup launched in Australia in June and Australian boutiques on the platform have since seen 80 percent growth in orders over the past few months.

Shoptiques launched back in 2011 with the hope of bringing boutique shopping online. The challenge for most boutique retailers is that they don’t have the resources to keep up the site and compete online with major retailers like Nordstrom or H&M.

However, boutiques are perhaps in more need of an online presence since most of them are a single store in a single location, as opposed to a major chain that operates in many brick-and-mortar locations in a single market.

Shoptiques solves these problems for boutiques, giving them an easy interface and a handful of resources to put their products up for sale on the web.

This can include photo shoots of the products, email marketing, inventory management and shipping, depending on which tier the boutique is paying for.

All boutiques pay a one-time set up fee, based on country, currency, and services provided by Shoptiques. From there pay out Shoptiques for each transaction made on the platform, which can range from 15 percent to 25 percent.

The company has more than 800,000 email subscribers, though wouldn’t share MAUs.

Shoptiques has raised a total of $2 million across two rounds of funding, according toCrunchBase.
