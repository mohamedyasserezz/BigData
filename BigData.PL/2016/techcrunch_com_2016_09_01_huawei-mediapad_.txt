Huawei debuts a new 8.4-inch tablet

A bunch of new products out of Huawei this morning, as the company kicked the second day of IFA press conferences. In addition to two new entries in the company’s mid-tier Nova line, it also introduced a new 8.4-inch tablet the MediaPad M3.

At the center of the tablet is a 2560 x 1600 2K wide-angle display with a 359PPI pixel density. That’s all wrapped up in a slim full-metal body. The company has also paid close attention to the speakers here, with a front facing pair created in partnership with Harman/Kardon, and for good measure, the slate will ship with a pair of Huawei’s new AKG earphones, which promise improved sound over their predecessor.

Inside, you’ll find a 16nm octa-core chipset and a beefy 5,100mAh battery that promises up to 11 hours of life on a charge. There’s 4GB of RAM on board and up to 64GB of storage. Interestingly, the fingerprint reader takes on more features than simple unlocking. The space can also be used to interact with the phone, including left and right swiping for navigation.

The new tablet starts at 349 euro here in Europe.
