Rogue One: A Star Wars Story advance ticket sales start November 28

It’s getting closer to the end of the year and that means A) 2016 is almost over, which is great because it’s among the worst of years, and B) there’s a new Star Wars movie coming soon, which is also great and may help 2016 redeem itself to the tiniest degree. Now, you can circle Monday, November 28 as the day to get your tickets forRogue One: A Star Wars Story, which is arriving in theaters on December 16 in the U.S.

Rogue Oneis the first spin-off movie from the main story arc of the Star Wars universe, starring Felicity Jones as Jyn Erso, member of a rag-tag group of rebels tasked with seeking out the plans to the Death Star in a mission that precedes the events of the original Star Wars movie (Episode IV in the larger chronology).

The trailers (like the one above) show a lot of promise, so here’s hoping this one delivers. Darth Vader’s in it, and also Le Chiffre fromCasino Royale,so how can it go wrong, really? Unfortunately for all the Cyber Monday sales this also means I’ll be doing all my online spending exclusively on purchasing tickets for different showtimes ofRogue One; thunder stolen.
