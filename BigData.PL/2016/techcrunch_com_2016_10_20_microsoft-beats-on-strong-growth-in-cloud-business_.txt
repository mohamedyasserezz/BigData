Microsoft’s cloud business bets pay off in Q1 as stock hits an all time high

Microsofttodayreported earningsfor its first fiscal quarter of 2017 (because fiscal quarters don’t have to correlate with the all-governing force of time). Long story short: Azure and other office-based products are fueling revenue growth, as Microsoft mostly gives up on mobile. Also of note: Shares popped to above $60 in after-hour trading on news of strong growth in the cloud business, which is above its all-time high set in 1999.
