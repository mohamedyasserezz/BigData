I am admittedly the jumpy sort, so maybe the bar was low, but this AI-created trailer for upcoming sci-fi thrillerMorgandefinitely sent chills up my spine. And this is the ultimate troll becauseMorganis actually about a humanoid robot with advanced AI that essentially rebels against its creators.

WATSON IS PLAYING WITH US.

Seriously though, it’s more than a little terrifying that Watson was able to create this trailer after analyzing the trailers of 100 existing horror movies, and analyzing scenes both in terms of visuals and audio to come up with this resulting teaser. The Watson APIs paid attention to the effect of things like score and tone of voice on the ambient mode of the overall scene.

It’s a heck of a lotmore coherent than the first movie written by a machine, that’s for sure.
