Hillary mentions internet

Hillary says Trump “makes you just want to look at cat GIFs”, and she even pronounced it correctly.*

Hillary Clinton appealed to the tech crowd of San Francisco today at a campaign event, discussing technology in more depth than she or Trump has in weeks.

Clinton said that because of Donald Trump’s bragging about sexual assault and insults toward immigrants, Muslims and other Americans, “It makes you want to turn off the news. It makes you want to unplug the internet or just look at cat GIFs. Believe me, I get it. In the last few weeks I’ve watched a lot of cats do a lot of weird and interesting things. But we have a job to do, and it’ll be good for people and for cats.”

Donors in the audience cheered wildly, perhaps louder than after any of her policy promises. No word on if her uptake in meme consumption influences her stance on net neutrality.

*To be clear, she pronounced “GIFs” with a hard G the way it should be.
