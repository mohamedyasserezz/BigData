Huawei’s Fit is a no-frills activity tracker

The Huawei Fit isn’t fancy. The company’s leaving theluxury/weirdnessfor its smartwatch line, all bedazzled with over-the-top names Elegant and Jewel. Sure, the new fitness wearable is shaped like a watch, but its functionality is designed for those looking for a no-frills approach to tracking.

It’s got a 1.04-inch monochrome touchscreen and a design the company describes as the “epitome of modern minimalism” in its press material. That means a simple face devoid of the metallic chrome you’ll see on the company’s other wearable. “Utilitarian” is probably the right word here. Though it does feature swappable bands if you’re looking to fancy it up a bit.

Most of your standard fitness tracking is on board with the Fit. The wearable will auto-detect whether the user is walking or running and features a number of different multi-sport tracking options, including treadmill, cycling and swimming – and yes, the thing is waterproof.

The Fit tracks distance, calories, fat burning and sleep, along with a built-in heart rate monitor and VO2 max readings. The company has also built-in a number of different running training modes for 5k, 10k, half and full-marathons. There’s no GPS present, but it’ll do your standard array of smart features, with alerts for incoming calls and notifications.

The Fit is available now in US with a price to match at $130.
