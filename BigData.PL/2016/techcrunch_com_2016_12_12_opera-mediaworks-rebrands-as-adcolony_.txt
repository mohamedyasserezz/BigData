Opera Mediaworks will change its name to AdColony

Opera Mediaworks will have a new name in the new year — AdColony.

Mediaworks started asthe ad-focused subsidiaryof mobile browser company Opera, but it split off when a Chinese consortiumacquired the browser business(and took the Opera name with it) earlier this year.

AdColony, meanwhile, was a mobile video ad startup that wasacquired by Opera. It continued to operate within Mediaworks (it says it’s the second most widely installed SDK among the top 1,000 apps, after Google), and AdColony’s Will Kassoy is now CEO of Mediaworks. Now the entire company is taking on the AdColony name.

“I am excited to unify the advertising business under the AdColony brand globally,” Kassoy said in theannouncement. “We are passionate about brand experiences that evoke emotion and drive real outcomes by combining both creativity with the next generation of advertising technologies like data science-driven automation and Artificial Intelligence.”

The name change will take effect in January.
