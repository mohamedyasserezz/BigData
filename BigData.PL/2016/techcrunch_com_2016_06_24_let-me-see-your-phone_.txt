Here’s one for your Friday. An older video, unearthed byTwitter user @iamjamajestya few days ago has been blowing up on the network. This group poem, performed byMorgan “MoMo” ButlerandMalachi Byrd, is one of the best expressions I’ve seen of love and trust in the digital age.

The video is from the 2014 Brave New Voices program put on byYouth Speaks, a 20-year-old organization in San Francisco that promotes literacy via spoken word performances, education and festivals that include poetry slams and other events.
