Coca-Cola made a selfie bottle; luckily humans only have 1,000 years left

Coca-Cola may be thinking ofSnapchat Spectacleswith its latest marketing ploy, a selfie-snapping bottle that features a camera in what can only be described as a bottle boot with USB out for transferring your images. The red bootie shoots a selfie whenever it tips past a 70-degree angle, giving you a down-angle image of your face as you slurp that sweet sugar sauce down your gullet.

The bottle wascreated by agency Gefen Team for Coca-Cola Israel’s Summer Love outdoor brand event, and the idea is that users will share the resulting pics on Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook — probably with an attendant brand hashtag, but I could not be bothered to find out what that might be.

In happier news, theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking thinks we’reprobably looking at another 1,000 years, max, before some kind of global cataclysm on Earth wipes us out as a species. He maintains this is motivation for us to figure out a way off this rock and into a future of interplanetary colonization. Given the selfie bottle and other recent developments, we should ask ourselves if continued survival is something we really deserve.
