Another Spectacle-selling Snapbot pops up at Brentwood Country Mart in LA

Snapchat now has not one, but two Spectacle-selling Snapbots deployed at the same time. The second dropped Wednesday morning at 10 AM ET (7 AM PT) at aspot near Santa Monica at the Brentwood Country Martin Los Angeles.

The Brentwood Country Mart is a shopping and for spot in L.A.’s Brentwood district, which actually hosts a petting zoo, too. This is the third time a Snapbot has dropped in the Los Angeles area, which makes sense given that Snap, Inc. is based there and it’s the perfect place to sell a gadget that’s trying to be more of a fashion statement and hype acquisition than an early adopter lure for nerds.

The new spot doesn’t appear to be a permanent one, like the location in NYC next to the Central Park Apple Store, which is set to run through New Year’s and restocks at least once daily. So, if you’re in the area and still want some Specs, head down early and expect a line.

Two of these out in the wild at once is a promising sign for people hoping these become available more widely. It’s a 100 percent increase over the previous number of total worldwide locations, after all.
