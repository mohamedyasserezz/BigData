Of course Hollywood is working on a Tinder movie

It’s not quiteSteve JobsorThe Social Network. ThinkFriends With Benefits. The writing team behind that 2011 Justin Timberlake/Mila Kunis vehicle has been given the early thumbs-up from Warner Bros. for their upcoming Tinder-centric romantic comedy.

The studio is developing the apparently Comic Book Guy-inspired script,Worst Tinder Date Ever, penned by romantic comedy vets Keith Merryman and David A. Newman, who also wrote 2011’sThink Like a Manand its various offshoots, along with the Hallmark Channel’s loosely tech-inspiredMystery Girl, which boasts the IMDB synopsis,

A man sends secret admirer e-mails to his crush but an e-mail address mix-up causes the notes to go to the woman’s lovelorn coworker instead.

We’ve all been there, right?

The new script has shades of 1991’sMystery Date.According toThe Hollywood Reporter, the film centers around a Tinder date that “generates several disasters.” Plot twist: the potential couple falls in love in spite of it all. According to the report, the planned film was inspired, at least in part, by a Warner exec’s bad dates. As the saying goes, producing a major motion picture based on your unfortunate experiences is the best revenge.
