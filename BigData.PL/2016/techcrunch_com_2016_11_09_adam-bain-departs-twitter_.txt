Anthony Noto, currently Twitter’s chief financial officer, will replace Bain as COO, according toa regulatory filing. Noto will continue to serve as CFO, as well, until the company finds someone new for the role.

This shift comes at a tumultuous time for Twitter, with the companylaying off 9 percent of its workforcelast month after failing to find an acquirer. Twitter stock actually popped this morning followinga surge of user activity during the election of Donald Trump, though as I write this, it’s down 3 percent in after-hours trading.
