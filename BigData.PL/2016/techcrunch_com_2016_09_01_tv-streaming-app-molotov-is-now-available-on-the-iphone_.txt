TV streaming app Molotov is now available on the iPhone

French startupMolotovhas been available in France fora couple of monthsalready, and it is rolling out new platforms. After launching on the iPad, the Apple TV and computers, the company is launchingits iPhone app. Android devices and recent connected TVs from Samsung and LG are up next.

Compared to the iPad app that Ireviewed extensively, Molotov provides the same feature on the iPhone, but on a smaller screen. You can stream live TV from dozens of channels for free. You can also pay to access more channels and features.

While the bookmarking feature has yet to launch, it’s already quite convenient to watch live TV and catch up on content that has already aired. I’ve found that surfacing interesting content on TV is also easier on Molotov than on a regular TV interface.

If you’ve been using the iPad app, you’ll feel right at home. The interface is a bit cramped, but once you’re watching something, the video takes over the screen and you can effortlessly move forward and backward.

The best part is that Molotov has signed deals with all major TV providers in France. While premium channels, such as beIN Sports, OCS and more aren’t available just yet, I’m confident that Molotov will find a way to make it possible to subscribe to these channels.
