OpenTable rolls separate country apps into single app with global booking

OpenTablewants you to book a table for dinner right after you book your city break away. The restaurant booking platform is consolidating multiple apps for different countries into a single multi-language global app that supports bookings at restaurants in other countries, it said today.

The idea is to make it easier for users to browse eateries and make bookings in unfamiliar locations and languages. The platform already includes diner reviews and menu info to help users pick a place to eat.

Consolidating multiple, siloed apps into a single interface that can reach across borders also looks like a strategy to maximize activity from an existing user-base by simplifying access to its booking platform.

The new global booking functionality covers more than 38,000 restaurants across its network globally. Cities covered include Berlin, Dublin, London, New York, San Francisco, Sydney and Toronto, and the feature currently supports five languages: English, Spanish, French, German and Japanese.

Commenting on the move in a statement, CEO Christa Quarles said: “This evolution in how we engineer our current country sites and apps, means we can now power great restaurant experiences across multiple cities, in multiple languages, becoming a true ‘Global Dining Passport’ for diners across the world.”

The veteran restaurant booking player wasacquired by hotel booking site Pricelineback in 2014 for $2.6 billion.
