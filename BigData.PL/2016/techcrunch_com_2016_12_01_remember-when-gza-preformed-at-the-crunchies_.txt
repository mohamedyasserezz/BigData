Remember when GZA performed at the Crunchies?

Way back in 2012, at the 6th Annual Crunchies Awards, GZA presented an award with then-writer Drew Olanoff. And then he performed. The video is above. Excuse the audio. It’s really bad for some reason.

This February TechCrunch will host another Crunchies award show. This is the 10th year. A lot has changed about the show over the years so we’re going to spend some time looking back at previous shows. Do you remember that time MC Hammer’s son preformed? Or when there were BMX riders putting on a trick show? Or how about that time Michael Arrington surprised Yuri Milner with an impromptu fireside chat?

Here’s a recap of the entire 2012 show. I’m about 20 pounds lighter in it.

Ticketsare still availablefor the upcoming show. It will be held on February 6th at the San Francisco War Memorial.
