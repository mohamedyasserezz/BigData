1.Hackers arehoning in on mobile devices. The latest example was an Apple zero-day hack targeting activist Ahmed Mansoor that employed not one butthreezero-day exploits that were addressed by a patch. The investigation suggested these were the work of a shady cybersecurity company, and the software may have been used for years by governments looking to compromise political targets. So, if you haven’t done so yet, update your iOS devices to 9.3.5.

2.WhatsApp came out with a huge shift in its privacy policy. The Facebook-owned messaging app will nowshare user data with Facebook for ad targeting. You have a few options: stop using WhatsApp, or take advantage of the partial opt out the app is offering users for a short period of time. Here’s a step by step onhow to opt out.

3.Google announced a major change to its search results. The company will startpunishing mobile sites that make content less accessible with intrusive ads, by ranking them lower in search results. These are ads that appear right when you open a site, take over the whole page and have the smallest possible button for dismissing them. Good riddance!

4.Can Apple social?Apple may be working on a video recording and editing appthat may be similar to Snapchat. There’s no mention of ephemeral content, butreports saidthe app is supposed to be easy to use with one hand for video recording, and mentioned filters and drawing functionality.

5.Tesla isn’t slowing down. The company’sstock surgedafter Elon Musk teased an announcement on Twitter, and then revealed a shiny new model.Tesla has a new Model S P100Dthat is boosting Ludicrous Mode up by 0.1 second 0-60 mph time.

6.Uber was justupstaged by a small MIT spinout. A much lower profile company called NuTonomy launched the world’s first self-driving taxi as its autonomous vehicles hit the roads of Singapore. The three-year-old company had been privately testing self-driving cars in Singapore since April. Uber,what say you?

7.What’s really going on at Hyperloop One – the futuristic transportation system proposing to shoot humans from point A to B at 750 miles-per-hour? (Besides a leadership shake up, lawsuit, countersuit and $80 million in funding.) The company is still in its early stages, but isgathering huge potential to change the transportation industry– if the company can bring itself up to speed.

8.For the first time,astronomers discovered a planet orbiting our sun’s nearest neighbor, Proxima Centauri. Proxima b is officially the closest exoplanet to Earth, but what’s important about this is that it’s at the right distance from its sun to support liquid water…and potentially alien life. Welcome to the neighborhood, Proxima b!

9.Android Nougat came out of beta. It’s available for Google’s own Nexus devices (the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Nexus Player), the Pixel C tablet and the General Mobile 4G. The most apparent change is in the notifications system, with a closer look to Google’s Material Design guidelines.
