Wacom’s got a couple of new Windows 10 pro pen tablets

New York Comic Con is a lot of things – a place to see watch people parade around in Netflix original series cosplay, an opportunity to get Lou Ferrigno to sign yourHulkDVD, and there’s apparently aLegends of the Hidden Templepanel later today. One thing it’s not is a tech show. But some announcements do manage to slip through here and there.

Certainly Wacom makes sense. The company dates back to the days when owning a tablet meant more than just having a big phone that doesn’t take calls. And while it’s branched out into more consumer facing products through its Bamboo line, professionals have always been the company’s bread and butter.

Just to clear up any confusion, the company’s calling its pro-devices “mobile computers,” a nod to the fact that they’re targeted at artists and designers, rather than the rest of us who are just looking for a large surface on which to play Fruit Ninja.

Targeted at 2D, 3D and CAD artists and designers, the company’s newMobileStudio Pro lineof Windows 10 pen computers come in six different configurations – four at 13.3-inches and two at 15.6. The devices all feature the company’s newly revamped Pen 2 input device and run full versions of Adobe Creative Cloud.

They also sport optional 3D camera and will double as a Cintiq-style device when pair with a Mac or PC via Wacom Link.

The tablets range 64 and 512GB of SSD storage, starting at $1,499. The 15.6GB models are quite a bit pricier, thanks in part to a 4K display. They’ll go up for sale starting in late-November
