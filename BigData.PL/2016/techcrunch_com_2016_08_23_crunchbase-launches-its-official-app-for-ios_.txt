CrunchBase launches its official app for iOS

CrunchBase, the database of startups, announced today the launch of its iOS app. The app allows users to look up information about companies, acquisitions, investors, funding rounds and business news, just as the website does.

“Now our users have the fastest way to search for innovative companies and leaders, read the CrunchBase Daily, and see what’s trending right at their fingertips,” said Jager McConnell, CrunchBase CEO, in a press release.

It’s not really clear if anybody would ever use the CrunchBase app over the website, especially because people are not crazy about news apps anymore. According to areport by The Knight Foundation quoted by Poynter, the growth of mobile news apps has slowed, with adoption rates mostly flat across the industry.

The finding matches results from a SurveyMonkey study, which revealed thatthe most downloaded and the most used apps in the U.S. in the first six months of 2016 are social media and messaging apps.News apps are neither listed in the top 30 of the most downloaded apps nor in the top 30 of the most used apps.

However, the fact that CrunchBase provides users with an extensive database about startups might encourage people to download the app.

Developed alongside TechCrunch, CrunchBasestarted spinning outfrom AOL/Verizon last September thanks to an investment of Emergence Capital.

The CrunchBase appis availablestarting today at the App Store.
