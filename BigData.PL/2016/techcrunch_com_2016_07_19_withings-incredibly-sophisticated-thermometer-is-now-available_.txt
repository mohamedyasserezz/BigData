Withings’ incredibly sophisticated thermometer is now available

Even though NokiaacquiredWithings for $190 million, the French company is going forward with its product releases. At CES, Withings announced the$100 Withings Thermo, a smart thermometer to track your fever. The device is launching today in Apple stores, on Apple’s website and onWithings’ website.

The device is a smart temporal artery thermometer, and arguably the best thermometer you can get today. It tracks your body temperature using your temporal artery. You just position the device on your temple, press a button, wait two seconds and that’s it.

Behind the scene, the thermometer has 16 infra-red sensors making 4,000 measurements in two seconds. That’s how it can be more accurate than your good old thermometer. The device features a tiny screen where you can read your temperature, but it’s bit more powerful than that as well.

The Thermo connects to your Wi-Fi networks or your phone using Bluetooth. This way, you can track your body temperature over time in case of long fever incidents.

And if you have kids, you can create multiple profiles and mark when they’re taking ibuprofen for instance. It works with babies and adults. Thanks to FDA clearance, the company is also working with Boston Children’s Hospital’s Thermia tool to manage a child’s fever.

Even if you don’t want to connect the thermometer to your phone, it seems like a neat little device. You can use it independently of your phone thanks to the built-in screen.

The device works with two AAA batteries. It lasts up to 2 years so you don’t have to charge it every time you want to use it.

The Withings Thermo is only available in the U.S. for now, but it should be available in the rest of the world soon. Similarly, I believe Withings is going to sell the Thermo in other stores and that the company just signed a temporary exclusive with Apple for the launch.
