Great news, hardware startups. If you’ve been waiting for the opportunity to sign up to display in Hardware Alley at Disrupt SF 2016, your wait is over.

Tickets to Hardware Alley are availablehere. For $1,995, your hardware startup will get a spot in the Alley for one day for up to two people from your company. If you want a few more people from your company to join in on the fun, you can purchase up to three additional tickets for $997.50 each.

While in the Alley, you’ll be front and center while thousands of other entrepreneurs, investors, innovators and general tech enthusiasts wander the show floor eager to see the latest and greatest innovations from companies from all over the world. These connections you make at Disrupt could lead you to your next great employee, or hook you up with an investor that leads the next round of funding.

Plus, your Hardware Alley ticket is an all-access pass to the main Disrupt conference whenever you’re not displaying in the Alley. That means you’ll get to check out all of the incredible speakers we have lined up for the various fireside chats and interviews that will take place during Disrupt — folks like Andreessen Horowitz co-founder and general partner Marc Andreessen and Naya Health CEO and co-founder Janica Alvarez, to name just a few.

You’ll also get to watch the Startup Battlefield competition, where a few dozen startups compete for the coveted Disrupt Cup and a $50,000 grand prize, chat with other entrepreneurs pitching their companies in Startup Alley, and keep the party going long after the show floor closes with the various parties and after-parties that take place throughout the week.

Of course, you won’t get to do any of it if you don’t sign up, and the only way to ensure your spot in Hardware Alley is to get your tickets before we sell out.Head over to our ticketing pageto get your tickets today.
