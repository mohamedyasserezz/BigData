The Nike Mag sneaker raffle raised $6.75 million for Parkinson’s research

It was pretty easy to lose sight of the bottom line in all of the hype and neon lights and childhood wish fulfillment. But at the end of the day, the extremely limited number of self-lacingMag sneakersNike was raffling off were supporting a really great cause

The shoe giant is releasing 89 pairs (a nod, it seems, to the release year of theBack to the Futuresequel that inspired them), 88 were given away as part of the raffle that closed a few days back. The company is also auctioning off a final pair at a gala next month.
