The latest trailer for the newest Star Wars movie is here –Rogue One: A Star Wars Story‘s second trailer emphasizes the father/daughter relationship between hero Jyn Erso and a character who seems like he’s a key architect behind the Death Star (Mads Mikkelsen) even more than in the last trailer.

Otherwise it really provides a lot more time for Erso herself to speak, and really generally increases the epic feel of the film, with a mounting, symphonic backing track and a lot of earnest concern about the future of the galaxy.

Rogue Onearrives in theaters on December 16 in the U.S.
