Tinder Boost, letting you pay to skip the line, goes live worldwide

Tinder Boost, the feature that lets users pay to have their profile shown first in the feed, has gone live worldwide as of today.

The company started testing the feature in late September in Australia, and has finally decided to let it loose across Tinder’s global community.

Tinder Boost lets users pay to have their profile bumped to the front of the feed for 30 minutes. While Tinder Boost is activated, other relevant, potential matches within the area will see your profile before anyone else’s.

Here’s what Brian Norgard, Head of Revenue and Core Product, had to say about it:

We are always looking at ways to improve our user experience. Our tests in Australia and the U.K. show us that users receive 8-10x more profile views and 3x more matches on average when Boost is activated.

Tinderis still testing pricing, but we’re seeing single Boosts go for $1.99 to $3.99. As expected, packages are priced at a discount based on the volume of Boosts you buy in a package.

Tinder Boost is being treated as a separate premium feature from those usually included with Tinder Plus, the monthly ad-free premium Tinder membership that includes unlimited swipes and free weekly Super Likes.

The update seems to be rolling out slowly in the App Store, but it’ll likely hit most users’ phones over the next few days.
