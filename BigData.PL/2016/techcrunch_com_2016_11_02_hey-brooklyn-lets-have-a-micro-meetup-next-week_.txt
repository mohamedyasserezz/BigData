Hey, Brooklyn, let’s have a micro-meetup next week

Hey, New Yorkers, I’m starting up my series of micro-meetups in New York with a special tasting at theVan Brunt Stillhouse. The founder, Daric Schlesselman, is a friend of TC and showed off his wares at the last New York Disrupt and he’s offering us a special tasting on Thursday, November 10, 2016 at 7:00 PM. It’s way down in Red Hook, so put on your hiking shoes and let’s see what we can see.

This is more of a social gathering, but I’d love to hear your pitches. You canRSVP hereand I hope to see you at the Stillhouse.

The address is 6 Bay Street, Brooklyn, NY and the tasting costs $10, payable at the place. We can stroll over to another spot for beers after we’re done.
