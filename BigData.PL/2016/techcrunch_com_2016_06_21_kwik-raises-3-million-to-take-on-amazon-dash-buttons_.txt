Amazon Dash buttonshave been gaining traction and Kwik thinks there is room for a competitor. The Tel Aviv-based startup has designed a similar product and is working with Domino’s, Budweiser, Huggies and other brands to make ordering a pizza as easy as pressing a button — literally.

And the team is announcing that Norwest Venture Partners is leading a $3 million seed round to help Kwik fulfill their vision. The startup hopes that this capital will help them move beyond their beta-testing in Israel and expand to the U.S.

“Consumers like the convenience and simplicity of smart buttons,” said Sergio Monsalve, partner at Norwest Venture Partners. “This market is too big for only one player.”

Monsalve also believes that Kwik’s approach, which lets brands choose their delivery and payment partners, will encourage more companies to sign up for Kwik. “Their open ecosystem will enable the growth of many businesses, all along the supply chain.”

The buttons are free for consumers, but Kwik makes money by taking a cut of each transaction. Kwik acts as a liaison between the delivery and fulfillment partners.

Founder and CEO Ofer Klein told TechCrunch that he believes “any product which is a repeated service” is ripe for button-making. Coffee, pet food, or even taxis could all be ordered with just a tap.

Klein argues that physical buttons are more convenient than using a smartphone app. Some people, including senior citizens who may be less internet-savvy, like the simplicity of ordering a repeat transaction in just a tap. Klein said that early adopters are his targeted demographic, however.

Perhaps we are reaching peak laziness, but Klein insists that “people would like to just not think” and see their pizza and beer arrive.
