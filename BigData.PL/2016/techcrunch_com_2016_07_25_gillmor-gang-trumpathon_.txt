Gillmor Gang: Trumpathon

The Gillmor Gang â€” Frank Radice, Kevin Marks, Keith Teare, and Steve Gillmor. Recorded live Friday, July 22, 2016. The Gillmor Gang survives the Trump National Convention and its subsequent Trump Bump with the inaugural live session from Gillmor Gang Studios East. As the saying goes, it always gets darker just before it gets even worse.
