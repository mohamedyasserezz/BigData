Lyft tests Line memberships to help you save money

Lyft is testing out membership passes to let passengers ride for less money in November,the company announced on its blog today.

There are two types of passes: a $20 one that guarantees up to 20, $2 Line rides and a $29 one for up to 20 “free” rides. So, if you’re a power Lyft Line rider, $29 up front could save you a ton of money. If you purchase a pass, you also don’t have to worry about Prime Time. For now, “limited quantities” of passes are available to people in Los Angeles, San Diego, Miami, Chicago, Atlanta and Washington D.C. until the end of this month.

Lyft seems to be following Uber’s playbook. Back in July, Uber launched monthly Pool passes forthe month of August. For $30, you would only have to pay $1 for 20 Uber Pool rides.Uber also teamed up with Gilt Citythat month to offer passes for unlimited Pool rides in New York City.

This month, Uber launched an unlimited Pool option for people in New York City. Uber’s unlimited option cost $100 for 2 weeks worth of rides and $200 for a month’s worth of rides.

Unlike Uber, Lyft does not have an unlimited rides option…yet. Though, it’s not clear if Lyft will continue to offer these passes past November.
