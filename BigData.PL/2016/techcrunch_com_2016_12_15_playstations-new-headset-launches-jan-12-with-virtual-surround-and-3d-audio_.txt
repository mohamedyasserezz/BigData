PlayStation’s new headset launches Jan. 12 with virtual surround and 3D audio

PlayStation has a new Bluetooth wireless headset, an over-ear pair of headphones that’s launchingJanuary 12 for $159.99. The new cans are called the Platinum Wireless Headset, presumably to indicate how much more premium they are than what came before, which wasonlyGold.

What more does Platinum do for you, the gamer? Well it offers virtual 7.1 surround sound, but that was also a feature of the existing Gold headset. The Platinum is twice the price of the Gold, however, and the reason behind the price hike is the inclusion of PlayStation’s “proprietary” 3D audio technology. This is especially useful in PlayStation VR games.

With Platinum, Sony is bringing 3D audio support out beyond the real of PSVR, with support coming to standard PS4 games, beginning with Uncharted 3: A Thief’s End, and also coming to upcoming releases like MLB The Show 17 and more. In the video below, Uncharted developers Naughty Dog explain what they gain from being able to work with 3D audio.

The Platinum headset is also built with higher quality materials than the Gold, and is compatible with PSVR and Vita using an included 3.5mm wired cable. It looks like a nice upgrade, and noise cancelling microphones onboard will ensure you can talk trash effectively while you’re using them.
