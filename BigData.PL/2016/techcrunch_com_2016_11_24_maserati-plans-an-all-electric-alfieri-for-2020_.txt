Maserati plans an all-electric Alfieri for 2020

Maserati was said to be looking at 2020 as the target time frame for its first production electric vehicle, and now the company has confirmed toAutocarthat a battery-powered electric drivetrain option will be made available in 2020 for its Alfieri two-seater sports car.

The EV version will follow the conventional fuel-based V6-powered Alfieri, which is slated to make its product debut some time in 2019. Part of the reason for the launch window being out further is that the chassis design used in the Alfieri requires weight savings and energy economy improvements, which Maserati is currently working on; its existing product design plans are due for refresh after 2018.

The report of Maserati’s Alfieri plans follows anearlier account by Car and Driverthat their first vehicle would be a “grand-touring coupe” rather than a direct competitor for the Tesla Model S, but that it would also likely be a significant departure for Maserati in terms of its signature vehicle design.
