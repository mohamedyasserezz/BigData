Space isn’t the friendliest place in the Marvel universe, but at least Peter Quill (aka Star-Lord) and Drax have each other. The two share a moment in Marvel’s first video teaser forGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which is set to hit theaters on May 5, 2017.

The trailer also provides brief glimpses at the rest of the crew, including Yondu, and Nebula, as well as Gamora, Rocket and even an adorable, still developing Groot. The first part of the trailer makes it seem like we can expect some serious action, while the second part signals that we can be sure the humor from the first instalment will be plenty present, here too.

Marvel also revealed a brand new poster of the crew looking fashionable in black and white, which you can see below.
