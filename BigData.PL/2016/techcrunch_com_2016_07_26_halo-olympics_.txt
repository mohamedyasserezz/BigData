A couple of months aftertaking to the stageat TechCrunch Disrupt in Brooklyn to show off their neuropriming headset,  Halo Neuroscience revealed that a number of Olympic athletes from various countrieshave been using the systemto prep for next month’s Rio games.

According to the hardware startup, track and field stars Hafsatu Kamara of Sierra Leone, Mikel Thomas of Trinidad and Tobago and Mike Rodgers and Samantha Achterberg and Michel Tinsley of the US have all been training with the brain stimulation system in preparation for the upcoming games.

Thomas, a 100 meter hurdler, had good things to say about the system. “My goal with Halo Sport is to improve technical positioning during hurdles, and I’m excited to say that my technique has improved a great deal since I started using the device,” he’s quoted as saying in the release. “I feel much more confident about going into the Olympics this summer, and I know that I’ve positioned myself well for the rest of the track season.”

According to the company’s claims, the Halo Sport works by stimulating the motor cortex while training, allowing for better neuromuscular performance. The company is currently offering the headphone-style device for pre-order on its site, priced at $649.
