EveryStar Warsfan’s dream is to be there – to inhabit the rich world created by Lucasfilm and the creative minds behind the epic films and their surrounding media universe.ILMxLAB, the immersive entertainment division of Lucasfilm, is working to make those dreams come true.

Michael Koperwas and Diana Williams are two of the creative forces that help ILMxLAB make its magic, and we’re excited to announce that they’ll be joining us on the Disrupt SF stage.

Koperwas led the process of coming up with prototypes for some of xLAB’s earliest work, including the 360-degree video trailer forWarCraft,Skies over Azerothand the virtual realityStar Warsmobile-based experienceJakku Spy. His tenure at ILMxLAB extends from its founding in June 2016, but his career at Industrial Light & Magic spans 16 years, and includes credits on films such asThe Avengers,Rango,Harry Potterand thePrisoner of Azkaban.

Williams is a member of Lucasfilm’s Story Group, which is responsible for tying together the narrative threads across the expandingStar Warscreative universe. She is also the creative liaison to ILMxLAB, where she helps ensure the immersive augmented and virtual experiences the studio creates also blend in with the larger creative universes within which they reside. Prior to joining Lucasfilm, Williams helped bring critically acclaimed comic book seriesThe Gatecrashersto life.
