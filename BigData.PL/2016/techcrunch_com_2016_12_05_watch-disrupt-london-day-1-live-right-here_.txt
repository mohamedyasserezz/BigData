Good morning, friends!

Disrupt has landed and London and the fun begins right NOW.

Today we’ll be joined by some of the biggest names in tech, including DeepMind’s Mustafa Suleyman, Volkswagen’s Ole Harms, and Boston Dynamics’ Marc Raibert.

Plus, the Startup Battlefield begins today, with 14 European startups battling for a cash prize, the Disrupt Cup, and a lifetime of glory.

We’ve got cars. We’ve got robots. We’ve got AI. And we have plenty of thoughts on Brexit.

So sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. And if you want to chime in, we’ll be hanging out on the #TCDisrupt hashtag on Twitter.

BTW, select segments will also be live streamed on theTechCrunch Facebook pageand onPeriscope. You can also catch the full stream onTechCrunch’s YouTubeandTwitchpages.
