Moo is giving away $5k in products to future entrepreneurs

Turns out, most people aren’t all that into their day jobs. According to a study performed byWakefield Research, around 75 percent of 2,000 respondents said they are unfulfilled by their current job.

Part of that comes from the fact that work is work, but the entrepreneurial attitude seems to be spreading, with 44 percent of people showing more interest in starting a side business than they were two years ago. Millennials, in particular, are showing more interest in starting their own business, with 2 out of 3 saying they’d like to start their own business.

That’s where Moo comes in.

Moocommissioned the study as part of a campaign called “Find your 6-11,” playing off the idea of escaping your 9-5 job.

As part of the campaign, users are asked to participate in a little quiz that will help you figure out your passion project. Folks who share their results on Twitter are entered into a contest to win $5,000 in Moo products, including flyers, business cards, and other materials.

That said, I’m not sure how accurate the quiz is — it told me that I want to be a photographer, and anyone who knows me knows that I am absolutely horrible with a camera. Imagine how much it hurt to learn that I could have gotten “writer” as my result.

Still, no one should turn up their nose at the chance for free business cards.
