Announcing the finalists for the 10th Annual Crunchies Awards

It’s the moment we’ve all been waiting for.

Today, we announce the finalists in each category for the10th Annual Crunchies Awards show.

The Crunchies is a long-standing tradition in the tech world, where readers nominate products, people and organizations to win the tech world’s equivalent of an Oscar. Nominations are narrowed down into finalists by TechCrunch editors, and those finalists are then sent to the Crunchies Board, comprised of notable VCs, founders, TC writers and tech influencers, all tallied and transported by law firm Perkins Coie.

These categories range from Best Mobile App to Best Startup Video to Founder of the Year to Biggest Social Impact, meaning there is room for everyone to be considered.

But at the end of the day (this day), that massive pool of startups, people and organizations has been narrowed down to the best and brightest.

Without any further ado, let’s get down to business.

Congratulations to our nominees!

And for the rest of you, we encourage you to buy tickets to the 10th Annual Crunchies Awards on February 6th in San Francisco. Can’t wait to see you there!
