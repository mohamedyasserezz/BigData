Watch Werner Herzog discuss internet addiction in this clip from “Lo and Behold”

We’ve alreadywritten extensivelyabout “Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World“, the new Werner Herzog documentary/tone poem on the Internet.

The new feature is less an exhaustive review of the history of the technology that has transformed modern society, then a sort of meditative look at its past, present and future.

It’s an excellent work on a subject that clearly fascinates Herzog.

Ahead of our on-camera interview with the director himself (which we’ll air later today), here’s a taste of Herzog discussing internet addiction with patients at a treatment facility in Washington state.
