Pokemon Go creator Niantic’s CEO hacked on Twitter

John Hanke, the CEO ofPokemon Gocreator Niantic, has beenhacked on Twitterby the hacker group OurMine.

In the past 24 hours, the hacker collective took control of the account and posted a series of tweets, including one that identified Hanke’s password as “nopass.”

Of course, this isn’t OurMine’s first high-profile hack. The organization has broken into a number of high-profile accounts, including those of William Shatner, Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey (of all people!) and Travis Kalanick. In fact, we’vehad our own experiencewith OurMine.

But poor Niantic is now the victim of two separate attacks from OurMine, the first being aDDoS attackon Pokemon Go servers in mid-July.

The hackers posted the #OurMine hashtag within tweets on Hanke’s account, and claimed the hack “for Brazil,” as you can see in the image below, captured byCNet.

OurMine markets a service that will allegedly scan your accounts for vulnerabilities, and these attacks are predominantly marketing stunts for the organization.

This is yet another reminder to set up two-factor authentication across as many services as possible, and to use complex, unique passwords for each of your individual services.
