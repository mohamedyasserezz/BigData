Inventor Ken Mages sees the Internet as democracy in action

This week on theTechnotopiapodcast I talked toKen Mages, a Chicago-based inventor and co-founder ofSecure One. Mages has been working in computers since his college days at the University of Illinois where he started a business doing what would later be called desktop publishing. His experience in the tech industry is boundless and he’s a really easy guy to talk to.

He and I chat about the democratization that the Internet brings to human life and how we can move forward past the disconnections wrought by politics, religion, and geography. It’s a fun chat.
