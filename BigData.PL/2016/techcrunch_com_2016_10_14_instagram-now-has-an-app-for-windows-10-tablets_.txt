Although Instagram launched a Windows 10 Mobile app back inApril.

Instagram says any device running Windows 10 can use its app, which is available for download in theWindows App Store. Although, for Windows 10 devices other than tablets and smartphones, it notes certain features may not be supported — such as capturing and uploading videos or photos.

Features wise, the Windows 10 app includes theSnapchat-esque Instagram Stories, as well as direct messages and the Explore feed.

Users can also capture, edit and share content directly from their Windows 10 tablet device, assuming they have the necessary hardware to do so.
