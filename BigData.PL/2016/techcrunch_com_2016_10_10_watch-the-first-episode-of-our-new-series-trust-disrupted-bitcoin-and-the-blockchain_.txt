Watch the first episode of our new series Trust Disrupted: Bitcoin and the Blockchain

We have a new series launching this week called Trust Disrupted: Bitcoin and the Blockchain. The six-episode series, produced byStateless Media, examines the rise of Bitcoin and the tech that allows it to operate.

The first episode will answer all your questions about the Bitcoin platform and how it works. Why did futurists want to create a totally digital currency? How would it work? What will the effects of Bitcoin and the blockchain have on the future of our economy?

Episode one seeks to explain the blockchain, the technology that allows bitcoins to be transferred between entities, as well as the motives behind its creators. The episode also examines the platform’s future and how it will be received by governments and big banks, the very institutions its creators were trying to sidestep or even overturn.

Check out episode one above and episode twohere. New episodes will be released on TechCrunch.com or on ourYouTube channeldaily throughout this week.
