Strolling through the line at Snapchat’s NYC Spectacle store

Snap, the social media company formerly known as Snapchat, has launched aSpectacles pop-up shop in NYC. Inside the store, there is a Snap Bot (a vending machine full of Spectacles). Outside the store, there is a line — a long, winding line of people who stand out in the freezing cold to buy a pair of Snapchat-capable sunglasses.

Personally, I have trouble justifying standing outside in the cold to wait in line for anything. But obviously, these Snap fanatics felt differently.

So we took a stroll through the line a few hours before the store opened on Tuesday to chat with the folks waiting for Spectacles.

Enjoy!
