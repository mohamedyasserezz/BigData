Qualcomm shows off three new Snapdragon processors

While it’s true we don’t all have the pleasure of hanging at the Hong Kong Ritz Carlton for this week’s 4G/5G Summit, we can still bask in the chipmaker’s news from afar.

Arguably most fascinating among the San Diego company’s big announcements for the week are its plans to go big into the future ofcross-platform camera hardware, but it wouldn’t be a proper Qualcomm event without some real processor news. And as it so happens, it’s got a trio of new Snapdragon chips to show off, all succeeding older models.

The new Snapdragon 653, 626 and 427 all sport the company’s new Quick Charge 3.0 technology for 4x power delivery, as well as dual-camera support, adopted from the company’s 800 line of processors. Also onboard are a slew of advanced connectivity features like support for higher call clarity and an X9 LTE with CAT 7 modem.

For its part the 653 bumps up the CPU and GPU performance of the 652, while doubling addressable RAM from 4 to 8GB. The 626 increases the 625’s performance and boosts antenna signal, and like wise on both accounts for 427 over the 425.

The Snapdragon 653 and 626 is set to arrive by year’s end, with the 427 hitting early next year.
