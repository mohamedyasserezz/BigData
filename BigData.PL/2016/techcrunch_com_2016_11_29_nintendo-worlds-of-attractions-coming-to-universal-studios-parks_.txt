Nintendo will provide fans a way to put themselves in the game at Universal Studios Japan, Universal Orlando and Universal Hollywood, and it won’t require use of a VR headset. The Mario-maker is teaming up with the theme park operator for a new set of attractions that Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto and Universal’s Mark Woodbury describe as “worlds” for fans to experience.

Details of the new Nintendo parks are scarce at the moment, but Woodbury notes in the announcement video above that they’re creating entire “worlds,” which are designed to “transport” visitors “as if they had just walked into their game platform.” Miyamoto says that it’ll be like “Mario will finally feel like he came home” when the attractions finally open.

All the Nintendo “Worlds” will include attractions as well as shops and restaurants, and will open over the course of the next few years, but expect more details to trickle out gradually.
