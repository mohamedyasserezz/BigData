New York City brings smartphone payments to metered parking

Starting this week, metered parking spots in midtown Manhattan are going mobile with a new system that lets drivers pay via smartphone. Thenew ParkNYC appis tied to a car’s license plate number, working along the lines of an EZPass.

Drivers enter their parking zone and the amount of time they’re parking and it goes to work deducting money from the account. Drivers can add parking time remotely via the app to avoid a ticket.

The system fulfills Mayor de Blasio’s promise to roll out a smarter metered parking system by year’s end — and with a full week or so to spare. The system goes live to select spots in midtown, between 14thand 59thstreet, with plans to roll it out to all of the city’s 85,000 Mini-Meter parking spots by the end of next summer. The Department of Transportation will identify participating spots with new signs and decals.

The app is currently available for iOS and Android.
