Twitter’s Gareth Paul Jones, Amex’s Tamar Shapiro check-in to new senior roles at Foursquare

Now that the dust has settled fromFoursquare’s big split, the company is pushing forward with a few new executives and a brand new office in Los Angeles.

The company has recently brought onGareth Paul Jones— former head ofmobile partner integrations at Twitter, who previously held positions at companies like Apple, TRUSTe, and Google — as Director of Technology Services. He will be leading the enterprise technical services team and expanding technical integration support for Foursquare’s partners, such as Apple, Uber and Twitter.

Tamar Shapiro— former VP and Head of Global Analytics at American Express Digital — will join the company as VP, Head of Analytics. Given that Foursquare’s greatest asset is its data (both about the people it serves and the places they go), Shapiro’s twelve years of experience in analytics should prove beneficial as Foursquare tries to leverage its troves of data in the most refined way possible.

Foursquare says that it has brought on 60 new hires this year.

Alongside these new hires, Foursquare is also opening up a new office in Los Angeles, in the Playa Vista area. Most of the office will be comprised of a dedicated sales team that will head up client relations in the Southwest.

This follows the opening of a Foursquare Shanghai office earlier this year.
