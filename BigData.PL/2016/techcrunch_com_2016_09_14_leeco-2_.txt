LeEco picks up an English language film production company

In its press material, LeEco refers to as a “global internet company,” a phrase that doesn’t really mean that much on the face of it – but when you’re LeEco, it’s probably best to be purposely vague. The Chinese technology firm’s ultimate goal appears to be an everything company.

The brand, formerly known as LeTV, is probably best known for its China-based video and music streaming service, but of late, the company has been making an aggressive push into all sorts of hardware verticals, from smartphones to TVs, to a self-driving electric car carrying its own name earlier this year.

LeEco also made headlines this summer when it extended its television portfolio when it acquired California-based budget TV maker, Vizio.

The company is continuing its push into the English-speaking world this week withthe purchase of Dichotomy Creative Group, a film production company run by former Paramount pictures president, Adam Goodman.

Dichotomy is a young brand, having launched as a “nimble” brand focused on taking advantage of emerging video distribution models. From the sound of it, the acquisition is more about brining on Goodman than the company. The executive will stay on-board, serving as the president of Le Vision Entertainment (LeVE), in charge of the company’s English language offerings. Here’s the official company line on the acquisition,

Under Goodman’s leadership, LeVE will employ a filmmaking strategy that mirrors Dichotomy’s approach to producing tentpole films for global audiences, while also utilizing the Dichotomy Micro Studios banner in the lucrative micro-budget film business.
