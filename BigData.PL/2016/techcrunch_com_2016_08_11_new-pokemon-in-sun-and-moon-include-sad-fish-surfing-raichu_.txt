Please, please let me visit the room where new Pok√©mon are created. I want to know exactly what was going on when the team came up with Wishiwashi, a small, sad fish that becomes a group of slightly less sad fish when it reaches a certain level. Wishiwashi is one of three entirely new Pok√©mon revealed today for the upcoming Pok√©mon Sun and Moon games for Nintendo 3DS.

The other all-new Pok√©mon include Pyukumuku and Morelull, one of which has an ability called ‚ÄúInnards out‚Äù which is also fantastic. But that‚Äôs not all we learned about the game; we also got a peek at three new variants of existing Pok√©mon unique to the Alola region, the setting for the upcoming Sun and Moon games.

These include a Meowth that looks chilled out and fabulous, and a Raichu that just wants to hang ten all the time on its very own tail. There‚Äôs also a Marowak (big Marowak fan right here) with a flaming supernatural double-ended skull staff.

Finally, The Pok√©mon Company also gave us a look at Team Skull, the villains of the piece. There‚Äôs always some kind of ‚ÄòTeam‚Äô up to no good in Pok√©mon, and the Skull squad are it for this generation. They‚Äôre led by Plumeria and Guzma, who have a kind of dysfunctional mother/father dynamic with the peons underneath them. If none of this makes sense then you‚Äôre in good company. Also Team Skull Grunts have to buy their own tank tops, according to The Pok√©mon Company. ü§î.

Pok√©mon Sun and Moon arrive for the 3DS family of Nintendo mobile consoles on November 18. It‚Äôll likely be one of the biggest Pok√©mon launches in the franchise‚Äôs history, thanks to Pok√©mon Go, so it hardly matters what absurd Pok√©mon this generation brings to the table. Hard to beat afloating key ring.
