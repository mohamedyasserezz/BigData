Stealth Uber competitor Zoox valued at $1.5 billion

The race for self-driving autos is heating up; undercover startupZooxis fetching a value of $1.5 billion even before unveiling their first product.

TechCrunch has confirmed that the company recently raised $50 million from Hong Kong-based hedge fund Composite Capital. The round wasfirst reported by The Wall Street Journaland comes just months after$200 million in funding raised at a $1 billion valuation.

Zoox does not have plans to sell the cars directly to consumers, but instead plans to create a service to rival Uber. They haven’t announced specific timetables for its release, but have referred to it as a “five-year vehicle development program.”

The startup was formed by Jesse Levinson, a leader in Stanford’s self-driving car group, and Tim Kentley-Klay, an Australian entrepreneur. Zoox formed less than two years ago, but the Menlo Park-based startup has already hired more than 100 employees, some from companies like Tesla, Alphabet and Apple.

General Motors’ $1 billion acquisition ofCruise Automation earlier this yearhelped raise the valuations of auto startups. Sources tell TechCrunch that traditional automakers are considering buying more startups.

Uber has already begun testing itsself-driving service in Pittsburgh. The company also recently purchased Otto, to add to itsautonomous fleet.

But these vehicles are still highly regulated;Comma.ai recently threw in the towelamid much frustration.

Zooxpreviously raised fundingfrom DFJ, Lux Capital and Blackbird Ventures.
