Here’s what you’ll need to run Windows 10 VR headsets next year

Excited about forthcoming Windows 10 VR support? You should be, since it’s going to open up who gets access to virtual reality considerably, thanks to third-party headsets from established OEM partners starting at just $299. Minimum PC specs are now available, too – andThe Vergepoints out they aren’t too demanding, which is great news.

The into comes via a ‘Windows Holographic First Run’ tester application that appears in pre-release builds of Windows 10 aimed at testers, and reveals minimum requirements for running Microsoft’s virtual computing environment that include 4GB of system RAM, at least one USB 3.0 port, a graphics card that can support DirectX 12 (not a steep bar) and at least 4 CPU cores that include dual-core processors with hyperthreading capability.

So in addition to a much lower entry-level price for actually getting into a VR headset, users also won’t need to pony up for a super expensive rig for them to connect to. 2017 could really be VR’s breakout year, between this, PSVR’s continued rollout and Daydream VR support among additional Android smartphones.
