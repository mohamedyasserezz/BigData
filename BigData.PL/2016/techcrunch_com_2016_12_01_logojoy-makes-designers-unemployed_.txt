Logojoy turns design into an AI-powered, iterative process

If you’ve ever had to have a logo designed, you probably know that a lot of love, care, taste, years of training, tons of experience and buckets of knowledge goes into the process.Logojoypulls the plug on all of that and goes barreling down a different alleyway, unlocking the power of AI and machine learning to help you throw together logo concepts. The result is astonishingly good, actually.

The concept is pretty simple: You type in the name of your company, you pick some icons and your favorite colors and then you hit “go.” The machine scurries off and does its thing, before feeding you a stack of logos. You favorite the ones you like best, and hit “more logos.” Repeat until the heat-death of the universe, until you’re bored or until you have the perfect logo.

Observing the robotic thought process as you refine your choices is surprisingly good fun.

Once you’re happy with what you see, the site mocks up a series of examples of what your logo might look like once you’re a big, fancy company:

And if you really love what you see, you can hit “buy now” and for $65 download the assets that Logojoy generated for you. That might sound like a lot of money, but honestly, the results coming out of this overgrown cybernetic designer are far better than some of the ones I’ve seen come out of other solutions, such asFiverror99designs, with the additional bonus that Logojoy turns around your logos far faster, and if you never find nirvana-like happiness, you can just elect to not pay for any of the machine-generated examples.

If nothing else, Logojoy can be a fantastic tool for generating ideas that you can pass to a real design agency; Saying “Hey, I like these 5, can you do something like that” could potentially save a lot of back and forth.

Oh, and did I mention that it’s a lot of fun to play with? Because it is. And you should.Over here.
