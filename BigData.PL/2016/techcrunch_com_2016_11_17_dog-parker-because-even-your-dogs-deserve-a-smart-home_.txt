Dog Parker, because even your dogs deserve a smart home

Everyone says that dogs are a huge responsibility, but it’s hard to feel the weight of that responsibility until you own one.

Dog Parker, a new startup out of ERA, is looking to take out some of the stress of owning a dog in New York.

As you might imagine from the name, Dog Parker is a service that lets you park your dog outside of a grocery store or coffee shop while you are inside.

Dog theft is a growing problem here in New York, and many dog owners don’t feel comfortable leaving their fluffy friends tied up outside alone, even for a few minutes. This makes it difficult to multitask taking the dog for a walk while picking up take-out food in the evening or going to the coffee shop in the morning.

Enter Dog Parker.

Dog Parker is a individual-size dog house with internet connectivity. Paired with the app, Dog Parker members can reserve a Dog Parker near their favorite bagel place and let their little love bug safely rest while they pick up their Everything bagel on a Sunday morning.

Through the app, these users can view their dog on the web cam to make sure they’re OK, and users can also lock and unlock the Dog Parker exclusively (so no one can take the little dude).

Dog Parkers are also fitted with a UVC sanitation light, which handles surface level cleaning of the Dog Parker between visits. At the end of the day, maintenance comes through and does a deeper clean on every Dog Parker.

The company beta tested five Dog Parkers across nine locations in Brooklyn and is today rolling out a brand new model of the Dog Parker. The new Dog Parker, made in New York by the way, will roll out with 100 units this week in neighborhoods in Brooklyn.

Dog Parker members pay $25/year, plus $.20 per minute for the service.
