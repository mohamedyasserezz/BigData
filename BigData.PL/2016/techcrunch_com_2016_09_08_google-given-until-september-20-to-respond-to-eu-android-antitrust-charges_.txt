Google given until September 20 to respond to EU Android antitrust charges

Google has been given another extension to respond to European Union charges its Android mobile operating system is in breach of the region’s competition law.

The company must now send its response to theEC’s formal Statement of Objectionsby September 20 (viaReuters).

The EC originally gave Google until July 27 to respond to the charges it issued back in April, but extended that deadline to September 7 after Google asked for more time. The company has now received a second extension although this is the final one, according to a commission spokesperson.

We’ve reached out to Google for comment about the extension and will update this post with any response.

Specific allegations in EC’s Statement of Objections pertaining to the Android platform include that Google

Googlerecently lost a similar Android antitrust appeal in Russiaafter complaints from local rivals about how it controls usage of its mobile platform. Andearlier this yearRussia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service agencyimposed a fineof 438M RUB (~$6.7M) on the U.S. search giant.

In the EC the stakes are higher, with Google’s parent company Alphabet facing a fine of up to 10 per cent of its global turnover — so up to $7.4 billion — if found guilt of breaching EU competition law.
