Tinder brings “Swipe the Vote” worldwide, so everyone can have a say on Clinton vs Trump

Undecided voter? Still? Really?? Well, if you continue to be unsure as to where you stand on some of the most critical issues facing American voters in the upcoming election – like gun control, immigration, climate change and more – Tinder wants to help.The dating app is rolling out a pollto users both here in the U.S. and abroad that lets you swipe on the issues in order to be matched with the most appropriate candidate who matches your views.

Afterwards, U.S. users will be directed to the closest polling location so you can vote for the candidate of your choice on November 8th.

Tinder has run this “Swipe the Vote” campaign before. Developed in partnership with Rock the Vote and real-time polling platform Wedgies, the idea is to help younger voters learn about the issues in order to determine who should get their vote. Ahead of the primaries, Tinderhelped you narrow down the wider range of candidates,so you could pick between Bernie or Hillary, for example, or Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.

Now the “Swipe the Vote” poll has returned, with the focus on helping you pick between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. (Because if you don’t know by now, surely Tinder can tell you?)

However, this time around, Tinder has opened up the poll to users beyond the U.S., saying that this election is a global conversation. The company also points out this is the first time that millennials will be able to vote, so it’s likely hoping to prompt some chatter around the feature to encourage young voters to take action, instead ofbeing apathetic as in the past.

The Swipe the Vote feature will go live today in over 15 countries, including the U.S., Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia, Spain and the U.K., says Tinder.
