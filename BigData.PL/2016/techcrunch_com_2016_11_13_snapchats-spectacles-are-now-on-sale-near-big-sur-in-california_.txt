Snapchat’s Spectacles are now on sale near Big Sur in California

UPDATE:The Big Sur Snapbot issold out, so if you’re looking to grab a pair, you’ll have to wait for the next popup location.

Spectacles are on sale again, in their second ever pop-up location (the first was atVenice Beach in LA on November 10) – and people in and around Loma Vista near Big Sur state park are the new lucky lotto winners who can now purchase a pair of Snapchat’s Snap-capturing eyewear.

Thenew locationis way more remote than the first, but judging by the example of the Snapbot vending machine’s stint in LA, it should be selling Spectacles through today, and be refilled multiple times provided there’s interest (UPDATE: Snapchat staff on location are apparently telling people in line the vending machine in BIg Sur won’t be restocked today once it sells out). The long lines from Friday, along with high selling prices on eBay that are hitting 20x the original Spectacles spelling price, suggest a lot of people could be looking to pick them up – but the somewhat remote location might make for a very different scene.

If you’re curious about what it’s like to use Spectacles feel free to check out thefirst impressions of TC’s Editor-in-Chief and resident hypebeat Matthew Panzarino, but everyday users seem to love the things, too, so if you don’t mind a lineup (plus beautiful California coastal highway views) and you’re in the area, there’s probably no reason not to go down and get in line.

The second location indicates that contrary to prevailing theories, Snapchat won’t be making Snapbots available first at big urban centers like SF and New York. Instead, the company seems to want to provoke some interesting road trips with its rollout strategy – something which may, in part, be driven by Spectacle inventory scarcity, but which also finds with its brand advertising, whereinbeautiful millennial take beautiful road tripswhile enjoying the social app.

The Snapbot is atThe Big Sur Bakeryaccording to people on Twitter, so you can also carbo load while you’re picking up some Specs.
