Sen. Al Franken asks Uber and Lyft about alleged racial discrimination against passengers

Senator Al Franken has some questions for Uber and Lyft about racial discrimination following therecently released studythat says some of those companies’ respective drivers racially discriminate against passengers. The study,conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research, found that black people have to wait longer for rides in Seattle. In Boston, the study revealed that Uber drivers were more than twice as likely to cancel on people with “black-sounding” names.

In light of the NBER’s study and its proposed changes, such as removing names to identify passengers, Franken hasasked Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and Lyft CEO Logan Green in a letterwhy it’s necessary to include names and photos of passengers requesting rides, what steps Uber and Lyft can take to dissuade drivers from canceling rides on people with “black-sounding” names and engaging in other discriminatory behavior, and what current policies Uber and Lyft respectively have in place to detect discriminatory behavior. Franken wants them to respond by Dec. 16, 2016. He specifically asks Kalanick and Green:

“Regrettably, African Americans and other racial minorities have long experienced discrimination when attempting to hail a taxi directly from the curb, with cabs either driving past African-American customers or refusing to accept passengers traveling to certain neighborhoods,” Frankenwrote in the letter addressedto Kalanick and Green. “Ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft have the potential to offer consumers relief from discrimination and destination bias, and have already shown great promise by increasing travel options within underserved neighborhoods. But as app-based driving services reshape the transportation industry, it is essential that companies ensure technology does not give cover to bias, whether intentional or unconscious.”
