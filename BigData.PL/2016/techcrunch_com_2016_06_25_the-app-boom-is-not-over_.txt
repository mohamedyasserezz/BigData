The app boom is not over

There’s a new wave of reporting focused on the post-appera. Recode announced “The appboomis over.” Quartz points out how most usersnever download anyapps. Let me be very clear: The appboomis notover.

The reporting on this topic made me think of an imagined Yogi Berra quote: “Nobody downloadsappsanymore, it’s too crowded.”

Let’s start with the facts. The real numbers are amazing —  we are in an unprecedented era of growth when it comes to revenue fromapps.

Revenue is hard to manipulate because it ties back to financial filings by Google and Apple and needs to be audited.

Takeappdownload news as an example. It talks about howappdownloads have stalled by pointing out the numbers for topapps.

In truth, the newerappslike Uber, Airbnb and Snapchat are all growing fast, while, expectedly, most topappsthat have been there for a while and have saturated the users, like Facebook, arenotgrowing any more.

To use this data to point to the end of anappboomis somewhat misleading.

There has never been a better time to be anappsdeveloper. Billions of users have access to cheap new smartphones, data plans are becoming available globally and theappstore owners like Apple and Google are being more generous than ever.

Apple is supporting lower fees on subscription revenue —  going from 30 percent to 15 percent in year two onwards.

As a SaaS guy, let me tell you this is an amazingly insightful decision by Apple —  if most developers can be nudged to think subscriptions, in turn making consumers pay more per month, you end up with a very long-term, sticky revenue base. Even more importantly, this revenue is cheaper and results in a virtual lock-in as consumers with more subscriptions are much less likely to switch ecosystems.

Go forth and multiply — yourapps.
