Spinn’s futuristic coffee maker is now available for pre-order

At Disrupt NY in May we had the pleasure of seeinga very cool hardware startupmake its debut on the Battlefield, looking to make waves in an industry very close to my heart (and mouth): coffee. NowSpinn’s high-tech coffee maker is available for pre-order, so if it piqued your interest earlier this year, now’s your chance to pick one up.

In case you don’t remember, Spinn’s machine is fully self-contained, grinding the beans to the correct fineness, then heats the water and uses a spinning cylinder to force it through the ground beans at the right pressure. It should make for great coffee, and the grounds are super easy to dispose of.

More detailsat the original post, or in their new video showing off the machine’s new look, with touch controls so you don’t have to rely on the app.

There arethree trim levelsshould you decide to treat yourself: original, which does all the basics and comes with $50 in credit for ordering coffee, for $299; original plus, which adds a carafe and $50 more in credit, for $399; and original pro, which has a larger bean hopper and comes with a milk frother and $200 total in coffee credit, for $599. It should ship in mid-2017, so unfortunately not in time for the holidays.

As with most pre-order campaigns, of course, those prices will go up should you hesitate. Not too many of the initial run of 5,000 units are left to buy, but more batches may appear soon.
