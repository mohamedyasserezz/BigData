Kwikset launches second-gen Kevo smart lock for $229

Kwikset, makers of the Kevo smart lock, have just unveiled the second-generation of the device with a fresh design and added security features.

The second-gen Kevo still comes with the same touch-to-unlock feature that made it popular back in 2013, letting users simply touch the lock to gain entry to their home. Users of the second-gen smart lock can also remotely manage access to their home from their phone, get lock notifications, and view the activity history of the door.

Plus, the new Kevo can connect to various compatible wearables and smart home devices, including Nest and Honeywell smart thermostats, the Ring and Skybell video doorbells, and Android Wear.

A recentinvestigationat DEFCON showed that most smart locks are easy to hack into, but Kwiksetâ€™s Kevo was one of few locks that only succumbed to a few hard blows from a screwdriver, as opposed to a software hack.

The new Kevo comes in three colors, Nickel, Brass and Bronze, and isavailable nowfor $229.
