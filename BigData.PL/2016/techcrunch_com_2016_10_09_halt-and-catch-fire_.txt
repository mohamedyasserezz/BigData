Samsung is reportedly temporarily halting production of the Galaxy Note 7

A little over a month after issuing a recall of its high-end handset and at the end of weekend littered with multiple reports of malfunctioning replacement units, Samsung has reportedly suspended production on the Galaxy Note 7.

In the wake of announcements by AT&T and T-Mobile that the carrierswill halt sales of the phone, Korean news agency Yonhapis reportingthat the electronics giant will follow suit, temporarily stopping production of the phone, according to an anonymous statement by an official supplier for the electronics giant.

“This measure includes a Samsung plant in Vietnam that is responsible for global shipments (of the handset),” an official for the company told the agency. We’ve reached out to Samsung for a response and will update accordingly when we hear back.

It’s already been a busy weekend for the company’s media department, issuing multiple statements in the wake of reports that users’ replacement handsets have also begun to malfunction. The first such story surfaced on Thursday, when a unit began emitting smoke while inside a Southwest airplane parked at the gate before take off.

At the time, the company told TechCrunch, “We continue to move quickly to investigate the reported case to determine the cause and will share findings as soon as possible.” Earlier today, as stories involving a number of other malfunctioning began to appear, the company added that “We are working diligently with authorities and third party experts and will share findings when we have completed the investigation.”

The US Consumer Product Safety Commission has also been looking into the matter in light of recent incidents. Samsung says that it is working closely with the government agency.
