Roland acquires a 70-percent stake in headphone maker V-Moda

About a month ago, Incipio acquired Skullcandy, and now Roland is getting in on the action with a headphone company  purchase of its very own. The Japanese instrument manufacturer revealed plans to pick up a majority (70-percent) stake in Hollywood-based audio company V-Moda.

It’s a deal that, unlike most acquisitions, has its own baked-in hashtag: #808Day. That is, of course, both a reference to the date (it being 8/8) and Roland’s ridiculously iconic drum machine. V-Moda also insists that it isn’t so much an acquisition as a “strategic partnership.”

Under the deal, V-Moda founder and CEO Val Kolton will retain 30-percent ownership of the company. The other details are staying confidential for the moment, though Kolton did have the following to say in a statement issued with the announcement,

It’s a strategic synergy that will bridge the high-quality sound, materials and design of our products with the legendary genre-changing sound expertise and commitment to excellence from Roland. Roland’s 808, 909, the contribution to the development of MIDI protocol and countless products helped to lay the foundation and forge today’s music, and together we can carry on the tradition.

As part of the aforementioned “strategic synergy,” Kolton will stay on as CEO, and V-Moda branding will still dominate the company’s packaging, while it utilizes all of the resources Roland offers up to expand its reach.
