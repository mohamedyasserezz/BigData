Apple’s Tim Cook is hosting a Clinton campaign fundraiser this August

It’s no secret Hillary Clinton has a friend in Silicon Valley elites. Now Apple CEO Tim Cook will be helping the democratic presidential candidate raise some cash for her campaign next month, according to an invitation letter obtained byBuzzFeed.

Cook, who will be hosting the fundraiser for the Hillary Victory Fund as a private citizen, not as an Apple rep, will be joined by Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives Lisa Jackson. The fundraiser is slated for August 24 and Cook plans to address guests at the event.

Neither the Clinton campaign nor Cook could be reached for comment on the fundraiser.

However, Apple’s chief seems to be working both sides of the political table this election season. He hosted a similar fundraiser for Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.

Apple employees have donated to both Republicans and Democrats, including the Bernie Sanders campaign, according to theFederal Elections Commissiondata.

Trump, whocalled for a boycott of Apple products, has not been extended the same warm hand from Cook or other Apple employees.
