This is Nintendo’s next gaming console, the Nintendo Switch

After over a year of secrecy and wild rumors, here it is: Nintendo’s next home gaming system, the Nintendo Switch (previously codenamed the NX.)

Nintendo released this preview trailer this morning. Though they officially confirmed that they were working on a new console way back in March of 2015, this is the first glimpse they’ve actually released.

As rumored, the system appears to be something of a home console/portable console hybrid. You’ve got a controller that connects to your TV for home use — but slide off the controller’s sides and attach it to the portable display (which also appears to act as the console’s brain), and you’re playing the same title on the go.

Nintendo has been saying for a while that they expected their next console to ship in March 2017, and the end of this video confirms they’re still on track for that timeframe.

The controller comes apart, allowing its left and right sides to slide off…

Then they slide right onto the aforementioned portable display/brain to form…

A portable unit! Voltron, Assemble!

The display can be used independently of its controllers and has its own stand and headphone jack

Nintendo will also ship more traditional “Pro” controllers if the slide-off style units aren’t for you

Multiplayer confirmed! You’ll be able to share one portable display between multiple people, each using one of the slide off “Joy Con” controllers or bringing your own. Nintendo also confirmed that you can bring multiple Nintendo Switch units together if everyone wants their own display.
