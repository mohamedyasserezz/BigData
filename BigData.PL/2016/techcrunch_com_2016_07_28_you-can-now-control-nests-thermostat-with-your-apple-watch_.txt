You can now control Nest’s Thermostat with your Apple Watch

If you own both a Nest thermostat and an Apple Watch, you might’ve figured the two would’ve learned to play friendly by now.

I mean, Apple Watch keeps you from having to pull your phone out of your pocket to see who’s bugging you while you’re trying to finishStranger Things, Nest’s thermostat keeps you from having to pauseStranger Thingsjust because you’re a little cold… surely, the two would work together in some sort of perfect, shut-up-and-let-me-watch-Stranger-Thingsharmony?

Before today, no. But now they do! Hurray!

Nest justdropped an update to their iOS appthat adds Apple Watch support, allowing you to control your Nest thermostat from your wrist like the 2016 smart-home dwelling spaceman you are.

Okay, but seriously, back to watchingStranger Things.
