Hey, Sao Paolo startups, want to meet up on Friday?

I’m in Sao Paolo for a few days and I’d love to meet with some startups this Friday afternoon/evening, October 7. I have nothing in mind just yet — I need your help to find a spot and decide on a time — but I’d be happy to hear pitches and talk about what you all are working on down here.

I’m staying at theHotel Tryp Nações Unidas, but I’m open to meeting anywhere. Email me at john@beta.techcrunch.com with ideas and we’ll set something up for Friday.

Hope to see you soon in Sao Paolo!
