Tomorrow is the final day to save $1,000 on Disrupt tickets

We’ve extended the deadline once, but it won’t be happening again. Tomorrow is your last chance to score early bird tickets to Disrupt SF 2016 for the super-low price of $1,995 each, a full $1,000 cheaper than they’ll be on Saturday.

Sure, if you still wanted to procrastinate just a little longer, youcouldwait until tomorrow, but why risk missing out on a deal this good? Get on over toour ticketing pageand get your tickets today.

That early-bird ticket gets you into all of the great Disrupt action. You’ll get to hear from several prominent investors, innovators and entrepreneurs who are slated to give a series of interviews and fireside chats throughout the conference. Folks like LinkedIn co-founder and executive chair Reid Hoffman, SV Angel Managing Partner Brian Pokorny, and the Chief Technology Officer of the U.S. Megan Smith, to name a few.

You’ll also get to connect with the hundreds of early-stage startups that are on display in Startup Alley and Hardware Alley, and check out dozens of companies in the Startup Battlefield competition, vying for $50,000, the coveted Disrupt Cup and, perhaps more importantly, the attention of the tech community at large.

And, as a bonus, you’ll get to attend all the parties and after-parties to keep the networking going long into the night.

The best way to get into Disrupt is with an early bird ticket but, as Disrupt SF 2016 speaker and two-time MVP Stephen Curry might say, the shot clock is running out. You have just one day left to get Disrupt tickets and save $1,000 in the process, so be sure to stop whatever you’re doing right now and get your tickets today.
