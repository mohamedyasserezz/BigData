Brexit: TechCrunch Disrupt London wants to hear from YOU

When life hands you lemons, sometimes it’s best just to get on with the damage control. That’s what we will be doing in the wake of Brexit atDisrupt London (5-6 December). We will be speaking to thought leaders and the wider tech community to understand exactly where Brexit leaves investors and founders. More specifics on that to come this week, but in the mean time TechCrunch is conducting an on-going survey of leading UK investors and founders.

The details

We are pushing out the survey each week through the week of November 28. The survey tracks sentiment on a set of questions and adds a new one or two each week as developments require. Our aim is to gauge Brexit sentiment in the startup community as it wrestles with an uncertain future in the UK. Our first survey closed last week.

What did we learn?

We will present the full results atDisrupt in London (Dec. 5-6)and we have several surveys still to go, but our first round threw off some interesting impressions.

Our respondents included people who were on both the Leave and Remain side of the initiative.

Because we really want to know, we’reinviting you to take the same survey. Your feedback is crucial to giving us the big picture so we can present you with the best possible analysis at Disrupt, where onDec. 6we’ll reveal the results of the survey, including what the community recommends as the most important steps authorities should take to inspire confidence among UK-based founders and investors.
