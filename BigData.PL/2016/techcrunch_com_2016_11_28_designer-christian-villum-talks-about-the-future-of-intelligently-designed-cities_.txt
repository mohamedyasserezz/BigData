Designer Christian Villum talks about the future of intelligently-designed cities

This week on Technotopia I talked toChristian Villum, a designer and thinker at theDanish Design Center. His vision of the future is simple: with the right kind of education and the right tools, cities can be reborn with design thinking. His background in hacktivism and making also allowed him to talk about the future of 3D printing in schools and cities.

He’s a founding member ofScience Frictionand currently builds amazing things at the Design Center where he’s happy to help small teams use the Center’s many resources. You canreach out to him here.
