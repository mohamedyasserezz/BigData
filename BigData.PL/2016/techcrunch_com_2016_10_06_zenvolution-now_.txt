ASUS’s Zenvolution event features four upcoming devices and one awkward portmanteau

Zenvolution doesn’t really roll off the tongue. But hey, you come for the gadgets – the clever word play is really just a bonus, at best. And the company certainly has a lot to showcase on that front, covering all of the requisite bases with a new laptop, phone, tablet and watch.

Let’s start with the notebook and go from there, shall we? The company’s got a new version of its ultrathin Zenbook, built around a 12.5-inch 1,920 x 1,080 display, that’s already drawing comparisons to the MacBook – but, then, that’s just kind of a thing people do when a new thin and light laptop comes out.

The notebook packs an Intel Core i7 into an 11.9mm, two-pound frame. Pricing on that one starts at $1,100.

The ZenFone 3, meanwhile, while already announced, is now getting some Stateside love. Its unibody design is set to arrive before the end of the month, sporting a Snapdragon 821 encased in a metal unibody design. There are (a slightly overwhelming) number of different configurations for the handset, including two sizes (5.5 and 5.7 inches) and up to 6GB of RAM and 256GB in Universal Flash Storage.

Prices range up to $869. The cheapest of the bunch is the 5.5-inch Zenfone 3 Laser, which can be picked up now for a reasonable $199. The Zenwatch 3, meanwhile, which made its debut on stage at IFA in Berlin not all that long ago, will run $229 in the US when it arrives, likely next month.

The new 9.7-inch ZenPad features 2K resolution and built-in LTE. The downside of the last bit is the slate will be a (TechCrunch parent) Verizon exclusive when it lands October 13. They seem to be getting all of the exclusives these days. The handset gets a very carrier-centric pricing plan, portioned out at $13.74 over two years – that’s around $330 when all is said and done.
