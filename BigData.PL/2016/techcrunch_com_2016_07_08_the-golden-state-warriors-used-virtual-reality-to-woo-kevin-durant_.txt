The Golden State Warriors used virtual reality to woo Kevin Durant

The Golden State Warriors laid it on pretty thick for Kevin Durant during the team’s successful free-agent pitch to the NBA superstar last week. In addition to having two-time MVP Stephen Curry and fellow Warriors’ all-stars, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, attend the meeting, the team also tapped into its Silicon Valley backyard to hit KD with a virtual reality presentation.

According toUSA Today Sports, the Warriors gave Durant a VR headset to show him the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, a courtside view at Oracle Arena and a look at coach Steve Kerr talking to his players in the locker room, so he could envision himself being there.The VR footage was accompanied by Drake and Future’s “Big Rings,” the Warriors theme song, which, incidentally, include the lyrics, “Oh you switchin’ sides? Wanna come with me?”

The high-tech effort paid off, as KD, of course, left the Oklahoma City Thunder team that he had played with for all nine years of his NBA career to sign with the Warriors on a two-year, $54.3 million deal earlier this week. Chalk this up to when virtual reality becomes reality.
