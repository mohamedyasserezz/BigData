Investors, here are the Startup Alley companies at Disrupt SF

We’re thrilled to announce that you can catch a glimpse of all theDisrupt SF 2016Startup Alley companies onour Startup Alley hub. In addition to being a great resource for investors, the site is also mobile-friendly so you can easily view info on all of your favorite Alley companies right from your mobile device at the conference.

The hub is separated into days and categories, so you can see all of the social companies that will be on display on day 1 of the conference, for example, making it incredibly simple to keep track of the companies you’re interested in talking to.

Each company on the hub has a profile that contains information about the company and their product or service, as well as any investors in the company thus far and how much money they’ve raised to date. The profile also contains contact information for the company founders and representatives so you can easily have all the information you need to get in touch at your fingertips.

And if you’re so inclined you can share interesting company profiles with your followers on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or LinkedIn with the share buttons on the left side of each company profile.

We wanted to make it super easy for all the investors at Disrupt to learn more about the companies that will be on display in Startup Alley and Hardware Alley, and we think the Startup Alley hub is a pivotal resource for you as you plan your days at the show.
