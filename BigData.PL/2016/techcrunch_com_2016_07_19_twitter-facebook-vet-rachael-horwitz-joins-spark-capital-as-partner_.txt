She will be the first marketing/comms partner at the firm.

Horwitz will join Spark’s growing San Francisco team as the first-ever Spark Capital Marketing and Communications Partner. This role will put Horwitz at the head of the firm’s marketing and communications activities, along with community events and initiatives.

“What drew me to Spark was the way that the partners talk about investing,” said Horwitz. “I assumed it would focus on market size, repeat entrepreneurs, or maybe something in the resume, but each of them said that they focused their investment on people who were truly passionate about their ideas.”

Horwitz added that she has a particular level of respect for product visionaries, and with experience at various stages of growth, she is excited to help Spark’s portfolio entrepreneurs tell their stories to the world.
