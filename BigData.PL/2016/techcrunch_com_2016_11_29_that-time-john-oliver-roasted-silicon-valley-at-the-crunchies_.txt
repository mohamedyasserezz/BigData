That time John Oliver roasted Silicon Valley at the Crunchies

Two years ago John Oliver returned to host the Crunchies for the second time.And he roasted the crowd. The video is below and it’s worth watching.

This February TechCrunch will host another Crunchies award show. This is the 10th year. A lot has changed about the show over the years so we’re going to spend some time looking back at previous shows. Do you remember that time MC Hammer’s son preformed? Or when there were BMX riders putting on a trick show? Or how about that time Michael Arrington surprised Yuri Milner with an impromptu fireside chat?

But first, let’s start with John Oliver’s fantastic opening monologue taking it to Silicon Valley.

Ticketsare still availablefor the upcoming show. It will be held on February 6th at the San Francisco War Memorial.
