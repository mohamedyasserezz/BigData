If you’ve ever bought a movie on iTunes you know how amazing of a deal this is. Typically iTunes sells HD movies for anywhere from $14.99 – $19.99 – making this essentially a 95% off sale.

The bundles are sorted by movie studio, and Lionsgate, Sony, Paramount, Warner Bros and Universal Studios all have a bundle. The movies are pretty good too – some of the included ones are The Hangover, The Cabin in the Woods, Wolf of Wall Street and more. As you can see they span all genres – comedy, horror, drama, etc.

Both HD and SD bundles cost $9.99, so it’s a no brainer to go for the HD as long as you have the storage capacity (or keep your movies in the cloud). The bundles also come with iTunes Extra content for any film in the bundle that supports it, if you’re into that.

iTunes also is featuring the 10 most popular movies from the last 10 years, but those are all at full price.

The $9.99 bundles only are available for 24 hours, so you should probably buy them ASAP if you want to stock up on your (digital) movie collection. The bundles are only available in the U.S store, and can be found oniTunes here.
