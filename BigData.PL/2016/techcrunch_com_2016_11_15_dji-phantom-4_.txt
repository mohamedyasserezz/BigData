DJI unveils a Pro version of its Phantom 4 drone

The Inspire wasn’t the only DJI line to get a refresh at today’s intimate event in Los Angeles. The company’s Phantom line is also getting a bump, with the addition of the Phantom 4 Pro.

Like the Inspire 2, the refreshed prosumer model features improved obstacle avoidance, courtesy of infrared light pulses that bring detection to the sides of the system, in addition to current 3D mapping of the drone’s front, rear and bottom detection.

The 4 Pro has a top speed of 45 miles an hour in sport mode (and 31 mph in P mode with obstacle avoidance switched on), coupled with a battery that promises up to 30 minutes of flight time on a charge. The system also has a number of new flight modes like Draw, which let users traces lines on the control to create routes.

The system has built-in ActiveTrack object recognition, which can distinguish and follow people and bikes. The on-board camera, meanwhile, sports a 20-megapixel sensor and is capable of capturing 4K video at 60fps. The system also sports a new safety feature that returns the drone to its last connected position after it loses a GPS signal.

The Pro runs $1,499, a price that includes the standard controller. Another $300 will get you a high-luminescence version of the control. It’s available now for pre-order and is set to start shipping in a week.
