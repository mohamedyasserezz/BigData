NYC’s transit authority urges people to stop using the Galaxy Note 7 on the subway and buses

New York City’s transit authority is understandably jumpy about the Galaxy Note 7. A week or so afterthe FAA issued a strongly worded warningasking travelers not to check or fly with Samsung’s new phablet, the MTA is following suit.

The organization hasn’t officially banned the device, but it has issued the following warning over social media this week:

MTA customers are urged not to use or charge their#SamsungGalaxy Note 7 mobile device on trains and buses.

The MTA was quick to add that, while no official cases of exploding Galaxy devices have been reported on its subway lines or buses, passengers are urged to, at the very least, power down their devices before traveling.

For its part, Samsungissued a recallof the devices earlier this month, after 35 incidents were reported globally.
