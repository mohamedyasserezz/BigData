Gillmor Gang: Predictions

[tc_unified_video code=”392e2e04-9a6e-36e9-bad7-58e5ed78a139″]

The Gillmor Gang — Robert Scoble, Frank Radice, Keith Teare, Kevin Marks, and Steve Gillmor. Recorded live Friday, August 19, 2016. The Gang goes mobile as in cars, autocurated Twitter notifications, the real reason bots are important, and a tribute to the inventor of all things debated. Bye bye.
