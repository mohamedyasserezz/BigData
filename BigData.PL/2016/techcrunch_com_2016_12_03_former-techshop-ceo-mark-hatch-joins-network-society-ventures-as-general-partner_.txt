Early-stage venture firmNetwork Society Ventureshas snagged TechShop’s former CEO and co-founder Mark Hatch as general partner.

Hatch is recognized as a pioneer of the maker movement, is a current entrepreneur in residence at UC Berkeley, and is a former Green Beret.

For those who don’t know it,TechShopbills itself as “a membership-based DIY workshop.”

The company charges its members a monthly fee to access work space and a bevy of hard-to-get, large or expensive manufacturing machines that are a designer’s dream, from the latest and greatest laser cutters, to CNC mills and 3D printers.

During his tenure at TechShop, Hatch says he grew the company from one to eight U.S. locations with many others in development, and increased its memberships and revenue by a multiple of twenty in just five years.

Hatch also helped TechShop raise over $20 million in venture funding, including $3.4 million from investors online at a time when so-called equity crowdfunding was only newly permitted by U.S. regulators.

Hatch resigned from TechShop in July this year as TechCrunchreported then.
