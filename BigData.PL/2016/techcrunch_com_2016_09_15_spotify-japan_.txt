Spotify will launch its streaming service in Japan this month

After more than aÂ year of hinting,Â Spotify isÂ finally comingÂ to Japan this month.Â The Swedish music streaming serviceÂ will go live in the countryÂ before the end of September, a source at the company confirmed to TechCrunch.

The Nikkei earlier this summer reportedthat the launch was imminent. The publication, one of Japanâ€™s leading business publications, said that Spotify Premium would cost aroundÂ 1,000 yen (close toÂ $10) per month, andÂ thatâ€™s the same price range weÂ have heard.

This launch in Japan, the planetâ€™s second largest music market based on sales,Â has been a long time coming for Spotify, which recently passed 40 million paying customers. Last October â€”yes, nearly one year agoâ€”we reportedthat the company was increasing its focus on Asia with plans to land in Indonesia and Japan.That Indonesia expansion happened in Marchof this year, and Spotify has been focused on bringing its service online in Japan since then.

Spotifyâ€™s Tokyo office has been open for 18 months butÂ it has beenhiring in the countryfor two years. Yet, it has sat back and watched as othersÂ haveÂ beaten it to the punch in Japan. Messaging service Line, whichwentÂ public earlier this yearand has nearly 70 million users in Japan,launched a music streaming service in Japanlast year, while Apple, Google andeven domestic e-commerce giant Rakutenhave piled in withÂ rival services.

Spotify has certainly taken its time building out a team in Tokyo â€” it iscurrently hiringfor nineÂ other positions â€” but there is some logic behind the delay.Japanese consumers still prefer to buy CDsand thereâ€™s plenty of resistance to streaming and other online models from record labels. But, with annual music salesestimated at nearly $3 billion, JapanÂ is a market that streaming companies hope can become equally as lucrative for them. Thatâ€™s particularly importantÂ for Spotify givenrumors of a public listingin the not too distant future.

Spotify has brokered deals with labels in Japan â€” and even hired staff from themÂ â€” and itâ€™ll beÂ banking that the competition, which havenâ€™tÂ exactlyÂ set the world on fire there yet, have created earlyÂ demand for streaming which it can piggyback on. Now, with anything up to a half a dozen notable streaming services available to consumers, Japanâ€™s music industry is beginning its transition to digital.

As for Spotifyâ€™s next move in Asia:we reported back in Marchthat it was casting its eye on India, and the country could well be its next target. However, we understand that thereâ€™s been no solid commitment on that from Spotify yet. Nevertheless,Â given the slow speed at which itÂ has expanded in Asia, we donâ€™t expect to see a move into India â€” or other new markets in Asia, for that matter â€” for some time.

Spotifyfirst entered Asia in 2013and it is currently available in fiveÂ countries in the continent: Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.
