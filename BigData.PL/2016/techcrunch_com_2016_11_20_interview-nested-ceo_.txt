Listen to Nested CEO on reluctant founders, fundraising, and why you shouldn’t do a startup

Last week I caught up with Matt Robinson, co-founder and CEO of London-based property tech startupNested. Prior to this he co-foundedGoCardless, a fintech company also based in London.

During our call we discussedwhy he left GoCardlessto start Nested, how too many bad ideas are being funded, why not everybody should do a startup, and Robinson’s top fundraising tips.
