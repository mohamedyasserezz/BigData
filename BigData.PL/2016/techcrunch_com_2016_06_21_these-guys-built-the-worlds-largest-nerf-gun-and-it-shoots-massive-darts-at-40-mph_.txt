These guys built the ‘World’s Largest Nerf Gun’ and it shoots massive darts at 40 mph

Bigger isn’t necessarily better when it comes to Nerf battles — but… well, this one wins.

It’s afour-foot-tallre-creation of the Nerf N-Strike Maverick — one of the greatest Nerf guns of all time. Oh, and it works. It shoots massive darts* at around 40 miles per hour.

(* “darts” here being pool noodles with toilet plungers stuffed inside)

Built byengineer/YouTuber Mark Roberalong withsome fellow YouTuber engineers, the mega-Maverick uses a 3,000 PSI air tank to fill an 80 PSI reserve cylinder.

Come for the hilariously oversized Nerf gun, stay for the glorious shot-by-shot comparisons between the standard Maverick and its bigger, badder, considerably less-portable brother.
