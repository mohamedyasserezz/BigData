Garmin makes fitness trackers for kids now

I’m doing my best to resist the urge to go all Andy Rooney here and complain about kids these days. You’ve heard that one before. And besides, with all of those new VR tools and Pokemon Going, kids are probably getting a better work out than they have in a generation, right?

Also, let’s be honest, when it comes to getting off the couch and moving around, we could all probably use a little motivation, regardless of our age. For that reason (and let’s be honest, because they spotted a potentially underserved demographic), Garmin’s offering up a new fitness tracker for little ones.

TheVivofit Jr.features the standard fitness ban step tracking, encouraging kids to move for 60 minutes a day and letting parents assign rewards based on activity through a free app. The band’s got a year of battery life and is water resistant so kids can take it swimming. Garmin is offering up some stretchy, kid-friendly bands, or it can be used with a standard Vivofit 3 straps.

It’s available now for $80 from retailers like Target and Buy Best and will be coming to Toys “R” Us later this fall.
