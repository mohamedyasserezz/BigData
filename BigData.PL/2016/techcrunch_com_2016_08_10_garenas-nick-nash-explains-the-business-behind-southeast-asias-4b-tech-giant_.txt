Garena’s Nick Nash explains the business behind Southeast Asia’s $4B tech giant

Quick, name a unicorn in Southeast Asia! The most obvious names that come to mind might be Grab, the Uber rival that iscurrently raising at a $2 billion-plus valuation, Lazada, the e-commerce companyAlibaba invested $1 billion into, or perhaps Go-Jek, the motorbike taxi on-demand service in Indonesia thatjust joined the billion-dollar club.

How aboutGarena?

Despite a low profile, the games company is valued at close to $4 billionfollowing its most recent $170 million funding round in Marchfrom Khazanah Nasional Berhad, the Malaysian government’s strategic investment fund, and Chinese tech giant Tencent, a long-term, existing investor.

That round makes Garena Southeast Asia’s highest-valued tech startup — if you can call a near-$4 billion company a “startup,” that is. Yet still little is really known about it.

Nash — who previously spent more than a decade with General Atlantic, heading up its ASEAN business among other things — covered a range of topics in our chat, including:
