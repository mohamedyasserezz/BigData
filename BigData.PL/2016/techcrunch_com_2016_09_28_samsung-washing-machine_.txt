Some of Samsung’s washing machines are reportedly exploding now, too

Probably not the kind of thing Samsung was hoping it would be dealing with in the wake of amassive Galaxy Note 7 recall, but here we are. Andhere’s the statementfrom the company’s media relations wing:

It is important to note that Samsung customers have completed hundreds of millions of loads without incident since 2011.

That message comes after the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning to owners of specific top-loading washing machines manufactured by the electronics giant between March 2011 and April 2016, due to concerns over exploding units.

The department pursued incidents filed by consumers in three U.S. states, including claims by a Texas woman that her washer “exploded with such ferocity that it penetrated the interior wall of her garage,” comparing the explosion to the sound of a bomb. The issue is believed to have been caused by “abnormal vibrations.”

Samsung says that it is “in active discussions” with the CPSC. In the meantime, rather than issuing a recall along the lines of what the company issued with the Note, it is simply recommending that consumers just switch to the delicate cycle when dealing with bulky items, bedding and water-resistant material, as “[t]here have been no reported incidents when using this cycle.”

The company is alsooffering a servicewhereby consumers can check to see if their own machines are potentially defective by entering a serial number.

A suit filed in New Jersey, meanwhile, claims that the company has actively worked to destroy evidence of the problematic machines.
