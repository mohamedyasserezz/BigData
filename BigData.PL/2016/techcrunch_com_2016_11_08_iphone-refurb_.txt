You can now buy a refurbed iPhone directly through Apple’s site

Some good news for folks looking to shave a hundred bucks or so off an iPhone, while still getting all the benefits that going through Apple’s official channels entail. The company is now stockingrefurbished iPhonesthrough its online store — which was previously limited to iPads, Macs, Apple TVs and the like.

As one expects from Apple’s official offering, the prices aren’t as low as other second-hand retailers out there. Typical savings on a device is around the $80 to $110 mark. Also not surprising — the company has yet to stock the latest and greatest in the store — neither the SE or iPhone 7 are currently represented.

At present, the selection is limited to the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, with prices ranging from $449 for the 16GB 6s to $589 for the 64GB Plus, both savings of 15 percent off the full retail price. The price includes a one-year warranty from Apple and, one would expect, a little peace of mind.
