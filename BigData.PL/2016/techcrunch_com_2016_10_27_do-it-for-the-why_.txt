Founder’s comment on Vine shutting down? “Don’t sell your company!”

Vine founder Rus Yusupov threw a ton of shade at Twitter with a tiny little tweet in reaction to the company saying Vine will be shut down soon: “Don’t sell your company!” TechCrunch has learned that Yusupov didn’t know about the impending death of Vine until we contacted him this morning.

Don’t sell your company!

— Rus (@rus)October 27, 2016

Yusupov was laid off by Twitter a year ago. He had started Vine in June 2012 with Dom Hofmann and Colin Kroll, but sold it to Twitter in October for a reported $30 million. Considering Vine went on to compete with Instagram, which Citi Group valued at $35 billion at the end of 2014, Rus seems to wish he had tried to run it rather than sell short.

Since launching in January 2013, Twitter gave Vine weak support, keeping the product at arm’s length despite cult popularity. While there were small updates to its design, creation tools and viral hooks, Vine never got the deeper integrations with its bigger parent Twitter to continue growing.
