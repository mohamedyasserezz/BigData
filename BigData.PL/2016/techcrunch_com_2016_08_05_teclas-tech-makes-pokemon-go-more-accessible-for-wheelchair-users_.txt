Toronto-based B corporationKomodo OpenLabthought Pokémon Go using its Tecla product, an assistive hardware device designed to make it easier to use smartphones, tablets and users for people who might not generally be able to interact with these gadgets, including, for example, wheelchair users with spinal injuries or multiple sclerosis.

As you can see from the video above, the Tecla controller installed on the users’ wheelchairs allow control over iOS or Android devices paired via Bluetooth. A control unit switches the target device for the hardware controller between their wheelchair, and the smartphone, and it also works with single or dual switches, including those that respond to light touch and sip-and-puff switches for users with less range of motion in their hands.

The team behind Tecla first did some feasibility testing around use of their system with Go in late July, but were able to run an actual field test with the help of local Toronto Tecla users Neil and James. The result? Some freshly caught Pokémon, as you can see in the video above.
