eHarmony CEO Dr. Neil Warren steps down, VP Grant Langston steps in

We’re all familiar with Dr. Neil Clark Warren, the CEO and founder of eHarmony and the star of all the dating platform’s TV commercials. But Dr. Warren is finally resigning as CEO, though maintaining his position as Chairman of the Board.

In his stead, eHarmony’s Brand Marketing VP Grant Langston will be stepping up to the helm.

Langston joined eHarmony in 2000 as awriter and editor, prepping to launch the original site. Before that, he spent ten years in advertising and music marketing.

Langston has been working on eHarmony’s marketing efforts, customer care, content, social media and the launch of new products for almost 20 years now.

This change comes at a time when eHarmony is venturing into verticals beyond dating. The launch of a new employee-matching product, Elevated Careers, is projected to account for60 percent of the company’s revenuein three years time.

The platform would use an algorithm to match employers with potential candidates based on factors like skills, personality, and more, not unlike the way eHarmony’s dating algorithm works.

An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified eHarmony as an IAC-owned Match Group property. eHarmony is not owned or affiliated with IAC.
