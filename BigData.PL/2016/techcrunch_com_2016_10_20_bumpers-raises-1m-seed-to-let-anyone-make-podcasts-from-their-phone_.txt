Bumpers raises $1M seed to let anyone make podcasts from their phone

These days, you can’t wander around the internet without running into a podcast. And yet, it takes a lot of time, energy, and equipment to make those podcasts.

EnterBumpers.fm.

Bumpers is an app that lets anyone make a podcast straight from their phone, using the phone’s built-in microphone.

The company just raised $1 million in seed, led by Spark Capital, with participation from Founders Collective and angel investors like Evan Williams.

The interface is built to allow for easy editing of the audio, by clipping audio into short phrases, letting you leave in and remove what you want. It can also take out background noise and offers options to add music and/or sound effects from its own library of content.

When you’re done recording and editing, you can publish the podcast to the app and share it through social media like Facebook and Twitter, or embed it on your website.

At this early stage, the company isn’t focused on monetization, but rather looking to build out the community and continue iterating the product.
