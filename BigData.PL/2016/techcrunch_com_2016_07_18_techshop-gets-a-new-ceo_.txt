TechShop gets a new CEO

If you’re into building stuff and making things and live near a major city, you might’ve heard of TechShop. Like a gym for DIY-geeks, the idea is that they buy and maintain all sorts of crazy expensive machinery — laser cutters, CNC mills, 3D printers, etc — and you pay them a monthly fee to access it.

According to an email sent out to members and investors by TechShop Founder Jim Newton, CEO Mark Hatch has resigned to focus on other projects. Hatch had been with TechShop for about 7 years.

Writes Mark in a note in the aforementioned email:

“After considerable thought and consultation, I’ve reached one of the most difficult decisions I’ve ever had to make. I’ve decided that I can help TechShop and the Maker Movement the most by stepping down from the day-to-day demands of being TechShop’s CEO. I’ve come to the conclusion that I can help grow the movement faster and better by opening up my calendar to more policy, educational, corporate speaking, writing and consulting engagements.”

Dan Woods, who previously helped launchMAKE Magazineand was already a member of TechShop’s Board of Directors, will be taking on the CEO role effective immediately
