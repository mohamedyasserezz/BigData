Accordion Guy Joey DeVilla talks the future of culture and IoT

Joey DeVilla is my blogging hero. He’s run hisblog for most of two decadesand he’s worked at Microsoft, Shopify, and Tucows. Most recently he’s taken on the mantle ofevangelist for SMARTRAC, an NFC/RFID company.

In this episode of Technotopia we talk about the cyclical nature of culture – how, for example, Nine Inch Nails sounds pretty tame to us now – and the future of smart things. It’s great to be able to chat with a guy as versed in technology and music as DeVilla and I think you’ll enjoy the special treat he gave us all at the end of the podcast. I won’t spoil it but let’s just say it’s something he played when he used to work with the Windows team.
