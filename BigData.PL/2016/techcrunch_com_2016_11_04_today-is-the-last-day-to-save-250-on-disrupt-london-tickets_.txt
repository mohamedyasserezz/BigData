Today is the last day to save £250 on Disrupt London tickets

Alright, startup fans, you’ve procrastinated long enough. If you somehow haven’t yet gotten your tickets to the hottest startup show in Europe, today is the day to do it. Today is the final day to get Disrupt London 2016 tickets at our early-bird price of £950 apiece, a full £250 cheaper than those same tickets will be tomorrow.

You can get those ticketshere.

What does your ticket get you, you ask? For starters, you’ll get to check out the incredible startups competing in theStartup Battlefield competition, an event in which promising early-stage startups take to the stage to pitch their products and services to our panel of judges in the hopes of winning $50,000 (about £40,600) and the coveted Disrupt Cup.

Then, you’ll wander around the show floor as you chat with hundreds of entrepreneurs and their companies in Startup Alley and Hardware Alley, learn about all sorts of things fromthe lineup of incredible speakerswe’ve scheduled for a series of interviews and fireside chats throughout the conference.

Finally, after the end of a long day on the show floor, you’ll unwind by checking out the after-parties that keep the party going long after the show floor has closed for the night.

Your early-bird ticket is your all-access pass to everything Disrupt, and today is the last day to get your hands on these deeply discounted tickets.

Disrupt London 2016 takes place December 5-6 at London’s beautiful Copper Box Arena in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. We hope to see you all there!
