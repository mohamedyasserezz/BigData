Apple brings back the peach butt emoji

Nobody can touch the peach butt emoji, not even Apple. A couple of weeks ago, Apple dropped the first iOS beta for iOS 10.2 with dozens ofnew and redesigned emojis. The world needs more emojis, I’m all for it. But Apple also accidentally redesigned the peach emoji and was a bit too literal —it didn’t quite look like a butt. Calm down, no need to grab the pitchforks. Applereleaseda new beta with a butt-looking peach emoji.

As you can see on the top image, the new peach emoji lookseven morelike a butt. Apple didn’t just roll back to the old emoji design. The company called its emoji designers again and asked them to redraw the peach emoji.

Emojis accidentally became a universal visual language withs its own set of rules. People now use emojis all the time to add emotions and personality to their messages. And sometimes, a peach can become so much more than a simple peach. TechCrunch’s Devin Coldewey wrotean ode to the peach emojithat sums up pretty well why it’s important to keep the peach butt.

Apple released iOS 10.2 beta 3 yesterday and it’s still only available for developers and public beta testers. You can expect the final version of iOS 10.2 in the coming weeks with a wide range of new emojis.

My favorite ones are the new professions. There are male and female emojis for a teacher, astronaut, welder, coder, business worker, farmer, scientist, chef, student, mechanic, doctor/health worker…

But theUnicode consortiumis also iterating to keep up with new gesture emojis. There will be a finger-crossed emoji, a shrug emoji and a facepalm emoji. Your friends will also need to update their iPhones before you can send each other astronaut emojis.
