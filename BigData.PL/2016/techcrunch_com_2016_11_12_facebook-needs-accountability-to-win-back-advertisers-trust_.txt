Facebook needs accountability to win back advertisers’ trust

The advertising industry let out a collective groan in September when Facebookadmitteda “discrepancy” in its reporting that led it to overstate how much time, on average, viewers were watching video.

Because the error was huge — numbers were inflated as much as60-80 percentfor two years — and in Facebook’s favor, some were quick to ascribe sinister motives. At the very least, it showcased the folly of trusting a media company to provide its own metrics.

“We have also been calling for a long time for media owners like Facebook and Google not to mark their own homework and release data to comScore to enable independent evaluation,” Martin Sorrell, chief executive officer of WPP,told Bloomberg. “The referee and player cannot be the same person.” (It should be noted that WPP has invested in the research from comScore.)

Advertisers buy Facebook video on a cost-per-view basis that counts a view at three seconds or more, so marketers didn’t pay extra for the error. The stats did, however, foster the impression that Facebook videos were more effective than they actually were, which likely prompted marketers to spend more than they had planned.

For marketers, this once again illustrates the monopolistic position of Facebook and Google. Barring a Microsoft-like government intervention, it’s FaceGoogle’s world now, and we must all adapt. Assuming, however, that Facebook wants to create goodwill in the market, here are five ways marketers can push the social network to do the right thing:

The reality is, no one really knows if Facebook was being devious here or merely sloppy. Either way, many brands were deceived into thinking their ads were working better than they were. That shouldn’t happen. Marketers have enough to worry about without trying to figure out who’s telling the truth and who has their finger on the scale.
