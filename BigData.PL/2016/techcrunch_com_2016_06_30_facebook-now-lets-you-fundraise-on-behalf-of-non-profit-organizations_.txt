Facebook now lets you fundraise on behalf of non-profit organizations

When people participate in events like the AIDS Walk San Francisco, which raises money for Bay Area organizations fighting the AIDS epidemic, you often see people post on Facebook that they’re looking for donations. Today, Facebook is rolling out the ability for everyday people to fundraise on behalf of non-profit organizations.

This user-focused tool is an extension of a featureFacebook launched for non-profits back in November, which enables organizations to better tell their stories and collect donations. With this new tool, anyone on Facebook will be able to set up a page to raise money for US-based 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations. Any organizations that want to enable people to fundraise on their behalf cansign up here.

Initially, only 1% of people in the U.S. will be able to create fundraisers, but the product will roll out to everyone in the U.S. in the next few weeks. Although creating donation pages is only open to people in the U.S., people in countries like Italy, Australia, Canada, France, South Africa and over 20 others can contribute money to those campaigns.
