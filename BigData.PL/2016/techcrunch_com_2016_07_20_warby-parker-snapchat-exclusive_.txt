Warby Parker is offering Snapchat-exclusive sunglasses

Warby Parkeris offering its very first Snapchat-exclusive product — limited sunglasses that are only available for purchase to its Snapchat followers.

The eyeglass retailer said it just shared a Snapchat story with its followers with a unique URL where, for a limited time, they can buy “head-turning Haskell in Crystal, now with new silver mirrored lenses” for $95. (I don’t have the URL to share with you, because that would kinda defeat the purpose; but if you’re interested, you just need to follow Warby Parker on Snapchat. Username: warbyparker).

Even if you’re not looking for a sweet pair of new sunglasses, this still seems like an interesting example of how brands are experimenting with ways to introduce more traditional, business-y elements like marketing and commerce to Snapchat.

Co-founder and co-CEO Neil Blumenthal told me via email:

Snapchat’s Lenses, Geofilters and Stickers separate it from other social networks by making communication more creative, fun and casual. These unique tools translate to commerce and align with our philosophy that shopping should be fun, especially when shopping for a highly social accessory like glasses which everyone immediately sees on your face and invites conversation. Offering this limited-edition pair of glasses to our Snapchat followers seems like a no-brainer as we strive to make buying glasses as enjoyable and convenient as possible.

This weekend, Warby Parker also plans to introduce location-specific filters in Los Angeles and New York, allowing users to show their own followers “where and how you’re spending your summer.”
