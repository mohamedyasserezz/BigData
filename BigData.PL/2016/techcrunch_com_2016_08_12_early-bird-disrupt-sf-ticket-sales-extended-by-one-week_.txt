Early-bird Disrupt SF ticket sales extended by one week

Don’t say we don’t ever give you anything, startup fans! While early-bird ticket sales were originally scheduled to end today, we’ve decided to give you one more week to save $1,000 on tickets toDisrupt SF 2016.

You now have until next Friday, August 19, to get your Disrupt tickets for the deeply discounted price of just $1,995 apiece. But you definitely won’t want to procrastinate any further, as we won’t be extending this great opportunity again.

Your ticket to Disrupt SF will allow you to connect with the hundreds of early-stage startups that are on display in Startup Alley and Hardware Alley pitching their products and services to the thousands of people in attendance.

Then there’s the illustriousStartup Battlefieldcompetition, in which a few dozen hand-selected startups will present in front of a panel of judges in the hopes of winning $50,000, the coveted Disrupt Cup and, perhaps most importantly, the attention of the tech community at large.

You’ll also get to learn from some of the best and brightest innovators, investors and entrepreneurs in the series of interviews and fireside chats thatwe have lined up throughout the show.

Plus, you’ll get to attend all the parties and after-parties to keep the networking and the good times going long after the show floor closes for the day.

Of course, you’ll need a ticket to get in the door, and the best, cheapest way to do that is by getting an early-bird ticket while saving $1,000 in the process.

Tickets will be increasing in price to $2,995 after August 19, so be sure toget over to our ticketing page today.

Disrupt SF 2016 takes place September 12-14 at Pier 48 in San Francisco. We hope to see you there.
