‘Silicon Valley’ co-creator Mike Judge is coming to Disrupt SF

Mike Judge is no stranger to Disrupt.

The first season ofSilicon Valley, the HBO show where Judge is co-creator and showrunner, revolved around fictional startup Pied Piper’s attempt to win our Startup Battlefield. It includeda meticulous recreation of the real event, andthe climactic jokeinvolved a … creative approach to winning over Disrupt attendees.

At the same time, Judge hasappeared on-stage at the real Disrupt, alongside his co-creator Alec Berg, plus stars Thomas Middleditch and TJ Miller.

But that was while HBO was airingSilicon Valley‘s first season. Since then, the story has grown to encompass executive power struggles, surprisingly wonky discussions of stock dilution and interviews-gone-wrong with tech bloggers. The show hasdrawn more praisefor its ability to capture the nuances of startup culture (thanks in part to help from former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo). And it’sinspired real startups.

So Judge will be joining us at Disrupt SF, where we’ll ask him about how the show has evolved, where it goes from here and his thoughts on broader tech industry issues likegender diversity.

Disrupt SF will run from September 12 to 14.Early-Bird tickets are available now.
