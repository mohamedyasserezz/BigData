Jeff Bezos has a cameo as an alien in the new ‘Star Trek’

When you’re worth like, $60 billion, you pretty much get to do what you want. You can launch your own space company, explore the bottom of the ocean and even make a brief, but resource-intensive cameo inStar Treksequel.

Star Trek Beyonddirector Justin Lin and producer JJ Abramshave confirmedthat Amazon headJeff Bezoswill make an appearance in the upcoming film as an unknown alien. Lin had nothing but good things to say about the exec during shooting, explaining that he, “he nailed it every time” during a hectic shooting schedule.

While Bezos’s bit essentially amounts to a quick appearance during a tracking shot, the billionaire showed up on set with a whole lot of security in tow, much to the bafflement of star Chris Pine. “I had no idea who he was,” the Captain Kirk actor told the press. “Not a clue. But he was obviously very important.”
