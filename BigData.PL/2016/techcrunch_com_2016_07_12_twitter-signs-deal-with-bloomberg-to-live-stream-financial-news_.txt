Twitter and Bloomberg Media have announced today that they signed a deal to live stream three Bloomberg shows, as well as the network’s markets coverage.

Full terms of the deal were not disclosed, but a person with knowledge of the deal said the companies going to share the ad revenue. They declined to share specifics.

The shows included in the agreement are “Bloomberg West,” which broadcast technology news, “What’d You Miss?”, which delivers global financial news at the close of the U.S. trading day, and “With All Due Respect,” which contains about political analysis.

“Partnering with Bloomberg will give people on Twitter the best way to see live financial markets performance combined with the live commentary on the underlying drivers and implications,” Anthony Noto, Twitter’s CFO, said in a statement.
