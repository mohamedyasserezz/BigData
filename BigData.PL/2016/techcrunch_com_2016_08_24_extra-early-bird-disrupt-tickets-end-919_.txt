Extra early-bird Disrupt tickets end 9/19

Attention, startup fans in the U.K. and around the world. While December may seem like a long way away, TechCrunch Disrupt London will be here before you know it, so it’s time to start thinking about getting your tickets to the best startup show in Europe.

Tickets to Disrupt London are available now through September 19 for the extra early-bird price point of just £800, a full £400 of the full retail price. You can get your extra early bird ticketshere.

That ticket is your all-access pass to everything that makes Disrupt great. You’ll get to attend a series of interviews and fireside chats with top entrepreneurs and investors, and chat with representatives from dozens of early-stage startups in Startup Alley and Hardware Alley.

And if that isn’t enough to convince you to sign up, you’ll also get to check out theillustrious Startup Battlefield competition, in which a few dozen promising companies pitch our panel of judges with the hopes of winning the coveted Disrupt Cup, a $50,000 (about £38,000) main prize, and the attention of the tech community at large.

Plus, you’ll get to attend all of the parties and after-parties that will let you keep the good times going long after the show floor closes up for the night.

But, of course, you can’t do any of it without a ticket, and the best way to get a ticket is to snag an extra early bird ticket before prices increase on September 19.

Disrupt London 2016 takes place December 5-6 at London’s beautiful Copper Box Arena, and we can’t wait to see you all there.
