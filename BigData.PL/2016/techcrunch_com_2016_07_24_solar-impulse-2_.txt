Of course, the plane and its pilots are already in the record books a few times over, having secured the record for the longest solo flight (from Japan to Hawaii) and crossed the Atlantic, both fuel-free.

The pilots anticipate relatively smooth sailing as Piccard takes control one final time. Though,according to the BBC, the hot, thin air above the region could pose some troubles to the solar plane’s motors. A series of delays have pushed back the flight over the year, including, most recently, a bout with an upset stomach that delay the initial July 18thtakeoff of this last leg.
