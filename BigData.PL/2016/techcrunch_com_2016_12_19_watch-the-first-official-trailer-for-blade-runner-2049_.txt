Watch the first official trailer for Blade Runner 2049

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haXvp8M9Cog]Blade Runner‘s sequel is nearly upon us, and now we have a first official trailer to help whet our appetites. The Denis Villeneuve-directed sci-fi epic looks like it’ll retain a lot of the atmosphere and grit of the 1982 original Plus, Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford show down already, in case you didn’t have to get enough to be excited about.

Blade Runner 2049is slated for release on October 6, 2017 in the U.S., and stars Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, Ana de Armas, Robin Wright, Jared Leto and more. The movie picks up the action 30 years after the events of the original, where Gosling’s blade runner character ends up on a mission to track down Ford’s Rick Deckard in pursuit of unearthing some long-buried secrets.

The original left viewers with a very poignant existential question, so it’ll be interesting to see how this sequel treats that (and this trailer doesn’t really provide any clues, though I looked). Still, there’s a lot of questions besides that the movie will be looking to answer, and it looks like the film is up to the task, based on this extremely short glimpse at what’s in store.
