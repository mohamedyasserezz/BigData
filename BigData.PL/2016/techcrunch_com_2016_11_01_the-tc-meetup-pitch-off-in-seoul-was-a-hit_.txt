The TC Meetup + Pitch-off in Seoul was a hit!

Oh what a night!

The TC Meetup + Pitch-off in Seoul was a night to remember, with a packed house, an amazing panel of speakers and judges, and some of our best-yet pitch-off companies.

Konolabs, an AI-powered scheduling assistant won first place in the pitch-off, with Daebaki and Zungle coming in second and third respectively. You can read more about themhere.

I also thought you might like to take a look at some of the pics from the event (below).

If you’ve never been to a pitch-off with TC, I highly recommend you look through these pics and check out the highlight reel above. Hopefully, we’ll see your smiling face at the next one!
