Update on the Chicago Mini-Meetup: We have a space!

We’ve found a location for our mini-meetup tomorrow! We’ll be meeting at 7pm in theMakeOfficesspace inthe Loop. There will be some free beers and maybe we can get some pizzas in or something. We’ll hold a pitchoff at 8pm and close up at 9pm and perhaps we can go carousing afterwards.

I’ll be picking thepitch-off companiestomorrow morning at 8am so be prepared. I know it’s short notice but remember an entrepreneur is always prepared. First place winners of the pitch off will get a table at Disrupt SF in September and two other companies will get two tickets each. It will be super great. If you’re a VC or Chicago bigwig let me know because I need two judges to join me on stage. Emailjohn@beta.techcrunch.com.

Please grab aticket here as space is limitedand please, if you grab a ticket, show up? I’ve kept things smaller on purpose because I’d like quality time with you all.

See you soon!
