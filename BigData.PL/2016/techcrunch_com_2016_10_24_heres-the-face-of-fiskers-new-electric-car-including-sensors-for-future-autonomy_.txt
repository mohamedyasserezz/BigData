Here’s the face of Fisker’s new electric car, including sensors for future autonomy

Henrik Fisker is back with a new electric car company, Fisker, Inc., which has emerged from two years of operating in stealth mode. Now, we have our first teasing look at the new Fisker electric vehicle, thanks to a shadowy image of the car’s front end. The image shows a car that’s quite different looking from the original Karma created by the original Fisker Automotive, which eventually had its assets purchased by Chinese autopart maker Wanxiang.

The new Fisker front-end shows a very aerodynamic design, with a centrally placed radar and camera sensor combo, which Fisker says is designed to be used for safety features, setting the groundwork for potential autonomous capabilities in the future. The car also has adaptive LED front lighting, with two angled headlamps which provide most of the illumination is the dimly lit overall scene.

The new Fisker car has also been shown tohave butterfly doors in a previous, similarly mysterious teaser shot. The car will also have a 400-mile maximum range, the company has said.
