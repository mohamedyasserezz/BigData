Another day, another drone that can perch on fences like a bird and carry deck chairs around in its scary claws.

Officially called the PD6B-AW-ARM, this drone is made byProdronein Japan and features two robotic arms. The 6-rotor drone can lift up to 44 pounds and lasts for 30 minutes on a charge.

The drone can lift objects and can even come to rest perched on a fence or railing, a feature that could be used for recharging while in flight. The arms are quite nimble. The ProDrone folks say that they can perform multiple operations and grab different things in mid-air.

ï¿¼Examples of these operations include the abilities to grasp and carry differently shaped cargo using its arms; to attach or join things; to cut cables; to turn dials; to flick switches; to drop lifesaving buoys; to retrieve hazardous materials, etc. Drones must be able to perform a variety of operations at high altitudes, over long distances, and in places where it would be too dangerous for humans.

I, for one, welcome our multi-rotor two-armed drone overlords.
