Brian Solis talks about why AI won’t suck

This week I got the chance to talk to a private hero of mine, Brian Solis. Solis is a digital analyst and speaker who talks about the future and how big brands – Coke, IBM – will interact with humans. His new bookX is out nowand it’s designed to help big companies survive the changing tides of business and tech.

Luckily, however, Solis didn’t just focus on his marketing work and instead we got to get into a wide-ranging discussion about future government, AI, and cities. He equates self-driving cars to the switch between film and digital – at some point it just doesn’t make sense to use film anymore, a prospect that both thrilled and upset this dedicated photographer.
