Apple sends out invites for an October 27th event, hints that new Macs are coming

Aaand there it is.

We’d been hearingthat Apple was planning to make an announcement on October 27th. Specifically, we’d heard that they’re finally,finallygoing to show some new Macs — something they haven’t done (outside of a refresh of the MacBooks) in over a year.

Sure enough, Apple just started sending out press invites to an event… and sure enough, it’s going down on the 27th.

Between those little hints and the whispers we’ve been hearing as of late, yeah: expect new Macs on October 27th.

Apple has also confirmed thatthey’ll be live streaming the event on Apple.comstarting at 10 a.m Pacific on the 27th.
