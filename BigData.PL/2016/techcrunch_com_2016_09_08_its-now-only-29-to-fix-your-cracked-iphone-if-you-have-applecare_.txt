It’s now only $29 to fix your cracked iPhone if you have AppleCare+

Followingyesterday’s iPhone 7 announcement, Apple is announcing thatnew AppleCare+ memberswill be able to get their cracked screens fixed for $29. This is big news for everyone who uses an iPhone with AppleCare+, and ultimately, anyone who owns an iPhone to begin with.

It’s worth noting how much AppleCare+ costs — $149 for the iPhone 7 Plus, or $129 for the iPhone 7 — on top of the existing cost of buying a new iPhone 7 or 7 Plus ($649 or $769 unlocked, respectively. By comparison, getting a cracked screen fixed without having AppleCare would cost you $149 , so there is some benefit to be had by enrolling.

However, the fun stops when you read the fine print: having an AppleCare+ subscription, which costs $129, includes only two repairs from accidental damage, plus a service fee. After you’ve somehow broken your iPhone 7 twice (thus confirming that you’re accident-prone), all repairs will cost $29 thereafter. This updated pricing applies to existing AppleCare+ customers as well.

As for the last-generation flagship iPhones (the 6S and 6S Plus), an AppleCare+ subscription will be the same pricing structure ($149 and $129), with the same policies as iPhone 7 AppleCare+ customers.

Try not to break your shiny new phone, is my personal recommendation.
