Marvel’s next Netflix show Iron Fist premieres March 17, 2017

If you, like me, are nearing the end of your Luke Cage binge and feeling the imminent absence of new Marvel Netflix content, take heart: Danny Rand will be making his streaming service debut on March 17, 2017 with the premiere ofIron Fist.

Iron Fistsets the stage for Marvel’sThe Defendersminiseries on Netflix, bringing in the last hero on the team alongside Daredevil, Jessica Jones and Luke Cage. Iron Fist is a martial arts expert who masters the power of the technique which is his namesake, which as you might imagine results in his being able to punch things really hard.

A March 17 premiere date will precede the summer launch timeframe forThe Defenders, and that could mean a late 2017 release date for the next season ofDaredevil, which Netflix has already teased will be coming in the same year.

All of Marvel’s Netflix programming so far have been great (Jessica Jones is still the highlight for me), so there’s good reason to have high hopes forIron Fist, and forThe Defenders, too.
