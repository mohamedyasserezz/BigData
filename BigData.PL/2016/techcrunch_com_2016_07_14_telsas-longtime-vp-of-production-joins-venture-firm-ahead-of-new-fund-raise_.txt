Tesla’s longtime VP of Production joins a venture firm ahead of its new fund raise

Greg Reichow, who in May left his post as Tesla’s vice president of production (and reportedly as one of itshighest-paid executives), has joinedEclipse Venturesas an investor.

If the Eclipse brand isn’t entirely familiar, it may be soon, given its growing star power. Venture geeks might recall that Eclipse was originally part of Formation 8, a firm that has since disbanded but that, before doing so, raised a $125 million fund that was designed to invest exclusively in early-stage hardware companies. (Its original name wasF8 Hardware Fund. Among its limited partners is Flex, the publicly traded contract design and manufacturing company formerly known as Flextronics.)

Former F8 partner Lior Susan now manages Eclipse, with a team that includes not only Reichow but longtime Sequoia Capital partner Pierre Lamond, who’d been an F8 advisor andjoined Eclipseas a full-time partner last year.

It’s been active, too. The firm has already invested in 27 companies, including making an early bet on the computational photography startupLight, which last week announced$30 millionin fresh funding led by GV.

According to a newSEC filing, Eclipse is also raising a new, $125 million fund.

The firm declined to comment when contacted earlier today about the fund and Reichow, but investors will undoubtedly welcome his involvement. In addition to his work at Tesla, where he helped oversee the launch of the company’s Model X car, Reichow spent more than seven years at the solar panel manufacturer SunPower.
