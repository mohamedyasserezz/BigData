Hasselblad does a first: the X1D, a compact mirrorless medium-format camera

With every camera being handmade in Sweden, the X1D is actually a special piece of hardware. It’s also apparently a compact mirrorless medium-format camera — and that’s a first, actually.

To out this camera, Hasselblad turned its focus to size and optical quality. The X1D has a 50MP CMOS sensor, ISO range from 100 to 25,600 and 14 stops of dynamic range. It also shoots in full HD with dual SD card slots, GPS and Wi-Fi. Viewing options for all your future shots would include a 3-inch 920K pixel touch display, or a 2.36MP XGA electronic viewfinder.

With just the 3200 mAh battery loaded, the X1D weighs 725 grams, which is lightweight for a medium-format camera.

Your port options are straightforward: a USB-C connector, mini-HDMI and audio in/out. Hasselblad also weather and dust sealed the X1D, so it’s adventure-friendly.

Regarding lenses, Hasselblad launched a new line of XCD lenses with integral central shutters; 45 and 90mm versions are available at launch. Thankfully, the X1D is still compatible with all 12 lenses from the pro H System, but requires an adapter, naturally.

MSRP? $8,995, which is about right for a medium-format camera, especially something from the Scandinavian imaging company.
