ZTE’s not-so-mini Axon 7 Mini is up for pre-order

Things are a little askew when we start referring to 5.2-inch handsets as “mini,” but then, that’s just the crazy, upside down world we live in. And really, for ZTE, it’s just a way of differentiating its new handset from its flagship, which, for the record is only just slightly larger at 5.5-inches, which was announced about a month or so before theAxon 7 Mini.

But none of that’s the headline here, of course. ZTE’s phones are, more often than not, focused on price. With pre-orders opening up today in the US, the company is unveiling the price of the phone, which comes in, as promised, at under $300 – if only just barely. The phone will be available unlocked for the admittedly nice price of $299.98 (because $299.99 would have been just a little too close to $300).

As far as other specs go, you’ve got two solid front facing speakers with Dolby Atmos technology, a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera, dual-SIM/microSD slots and the same all-metal body you’ll find in the slightly larger, $400 Axon 7.
