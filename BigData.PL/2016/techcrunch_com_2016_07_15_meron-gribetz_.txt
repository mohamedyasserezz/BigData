Meta CEO Meron Gribetz will talk the future of augmented reality at Disrupt SF

“Today’s computers are so amazing that we fail to notice how terrible they really are,” Meta CEO Meron Gribetz said as he kicked off the TEDx talk he gave in February. It was a fittingly grandiose opening statement, but one for which the Israeli-born entrepreneur feels he has a solution: neuroscience.

That’s not coincidentally what Gribetz was studying at Columbia University when he first set out on the path that would lead to Meta, and the science plays a large role in the creation of the augmented reality hardware his company produces.

The company started shipping theMeta 2 developer kita month after the CEO gave his speech. The hardware offers a promising peek into the future of AR, which,until fairly recently, has largely taken a backseat to the recent rise of virtual reality headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.

Meta’s vision is a world of computing dominated by holographic AR overlays, in which using our devices is simultaneously immersive and non-invasive – and the company has both solid hardware and some key venture capital to back up its dreams.

In September, Gribetz will join us at TechCrunch Disrupt SF to discuss his vision for the future of computing and the key role augmented reality will play in our day-to-day lives.

Early Bird tickets are available now.We hope you can make it out to the event this September.
