Halo 5: Forge gives PC users level creation powers on September 8

Halo 5: Forge, the level creation tool that lets players build their own worlds and create new game experiences for Halo 5: Guardians, has come to Windows 10 PCs. The free download puts gamers in the developer’s seat, and adds support for mouse and keyboard, and up to 4K resolution, likely beating out the Xbox One add-on in terms of giving you finer control over world building. Xbox One owners get another treat, though – Anvil’s Legacy, a free add-on for Halo 5: Guardians that adds a content browser to Forge mode on the Xbox.

The updates also bring more parity between both platforms overall, which allows for cross-platform play of content made using Forge. The updates also add new weapons, new pas and new customization features to the Xbox One game.

Forge for Windows 10 was first announced in May, and debuted on the Xbox One in December of last year. Its level building tools are somewhat reminiscent of Microsoft’s other big headline gaming property, Minecraft, but with more emphasis on helping players build new missions focused on multiplayer combat, with support for up to 16-player simultaneous missions on Windows.
