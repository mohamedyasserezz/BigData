Sen. Al Franken questions Niantic over Poképrivacy policy

Always with his finger on the pulse, Senator Al Franken (D-Minn.) today sent an official letter to Niantic asking about particulars of the Pokémon Go privacy policy.

“I am concerned about the extent to which Niantic may be unnecessarily collecting, using, and sharing a wide range of users’ personal information without their appropriate consent,”the letter reads (PDF). “As the augmented reality market evolves, I ask that you provide greater clarity on how Niantic is addressing the issues of user privacy and security, particularly that of its younger players.”

The Senator touches on theGoogle account“bug,” which wasrecently fixed(and, though I’m waiting to hear back from Google about this, may never have been as big a deal as we all made it), but also asks for specifics on several other items found in the terms of service and privacy policy:

I actually asked Niantic several times about these same issues yesterday but haven’t heard back yet — but I’m guessing Sen. Franken will have more luck.

The Senator is a reliable advocate for the progressive aspects of technology, but his office is also highly tuned in to potential violations of privacy by the likes ofvirtual reality,media servicesand new platforms likeUber.
