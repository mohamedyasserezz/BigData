SpaceX’s Falcon 9 explosion, Proxima b and SETI: Listen to TCBC Episode 3 with Emily Calandrelli

On this week’s episode of TCBC, the podcast where TechCrunch’s writers go in-depth about the beats they love and obsess over, we talk toEmily Calandrelli, our resident space reporter and the host ofXploration Outer Space– season 3 of which premieres this coming Saturday on FOX.

Luckily, there’s been no shortage of space news lately:SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket explosion, which occurred last week during pre-launch testing is the biggest and most-headline grabbing example. Emily talks me through what the incident might mean for SpaceX, and for its clients, and we go into some background about why SpaceX has had such an outsized impact on the space-based industry to begin with.

We also talk about two other recent pieces of headline outer space news – the signal received by a Russian SETI team whichoriginally seemed to potentially originate from life beyond our solar system, andProxima b, an exoplanet discovered orbiting the star nearest Earth beyond the sun, which occupies its own star’s habitable zone.

There’s also a fair amount of sci-fi in there, which I couldn’t help but interject wherever possible. It’s basically the podcast of my dreams, so I hope you enjoy listening as much as I did recording it.
