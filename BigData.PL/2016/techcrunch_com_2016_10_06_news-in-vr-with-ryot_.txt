News in VR with RYOT

RYOT, the Culver City, California-based virtual reality outfitsnapped upby the Huffington Post last year, works on the cutting edge of the news business, bringing audiences straight to the scene.

That’s an unusual use of the new medium – most VR startups focus on sports and gaming empires.

But RYOT took its VR team to the Rio 2016 Olympics, was there for the Democrat and Republican presidential conventions and rode along on a Syrian refugee boat with Susan Sarandon – all in the name of a new type of immersive journalism.

It most recentlypartnered with HULUto stream VR news and comedy shows from its studios in Culver City. TechCrunch caught up with the RYOT team to take a look at what they’re up to and find out what’s next for this unique VR startup.
