How to watch the final presidential debate online, if you dare

Hi. I know, I know. But listen, it’s only 19 more days. And at the very least, tonight’s third and final presidential debate is bound to offer the sort of entertainment value rarely seen outside of NASCAR crash compilations. Because, while we’re in a year of historically low approval ratings, the Nielsens are off the chart. And now, apparently, the“shackles” are off.So, it should all make for some fascinating reality TV.

Tonight’s debate kicks off at 6PM PT at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where the two major party nominees will be moderated by Fox News anchor Chris Wallace in a more traditional format akin to the first showdown. The event will focus on six key topics, including immigration, the economy and the Supreme Court, and once again, it’s set to run a full 90 minutes with no commercials.

As with the two previous Clinton v. Trump rumbles on the stump, there’s no shortage of ways to tune in. The list of channels carrying the event include C-SPAN, ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC. And naturally, there are plenty of ways to live stream online. Here’s a taste.

And don’t forget to breathe.
