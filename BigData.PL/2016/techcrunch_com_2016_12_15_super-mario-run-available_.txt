Super Mario Run is now available on the App Store

As its name clearly implies, Super Mario Run is all about forward momentum. It’s a simple matter of physics — you can’t stop a Mario brother, you can only hope to temporary contain him with a well-placed pause block. As such, it should come as no surprise that the portly plumberjumped the gun a bit in the App Store.

Nintendo’s long-awaited title was slated for a 10AM PT release today, but managed to sneak out a bit early. The one-handed platformer is now available for download on the iPhone and iPad. As previously announced, the title comes with a decidedly lofty $10 price tag, though Nintendo will be making a trio of levels available as a sneak peek of an end-of-world castle available for free.

The game marks a key shift for the company, which had long avoided the mobile platform in favor of its own hardware. In September, Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto hit the stage at the iPhone 7 event in San Francisco to announce the character’s smartphone debut, following in the wake of the massive surprise success of the Niantic-designed Pokemon Go.

The game offers an interesting take on the classic format, designed to play with a single hand in portrait mode. You can check outour early hands-on with the title, along with an interview with Nintendo of America president, Reggie Fils-Aimé.
