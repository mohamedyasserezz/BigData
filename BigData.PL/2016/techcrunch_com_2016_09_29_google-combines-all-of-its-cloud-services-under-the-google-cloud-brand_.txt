Google combines all of its cloud services under the ‘Google Cloud’ brand

Google for Work, Google’s Cloud Platform and the rest of the company’s cloud-based services are getting a new name. They have now been combined under the “Google Cloud” moniker. Google’s Diane Greene made theannouncementat a small invite-only event in San Francisco.

If you’ve been following along, today’s news doesn’t come as a total surprise. The Information previouslyreportedthat this change was in the works.

And just to confuse us, Google is alsorebrandingGoogle Apps for Work, which also falls under the Google Cloud umbrella. Google Apps for Work is now theG Suite(not sure I love that name, but I guess we’ll get used to it…).

The Google for Work/Google Cloud moniker encompassed a broad range of product, including core productivity apps like Gmail, Google Docs, Sheets and Slides, as well as niche offerings like Google Maps for Work and the Google Search for Workappliance. But it also includes the Google Cloud Platform cloud computing platform, Chromebooks, and Google’s enterprise mobility services.

As Greene noted during her keynote this morning, Google first considered the name Google Enterprise and used it both internally and externally for a while. Greene said the reason for that was that when she joined Google earlier this year, the company’s customers were still not sure whether Google was serious about the cloud, so the name seemed like a good fit. Now, however, potential customers know that Google is serious about enterprise, she argued.

“Enterprise — that was so June,” Greene said. “We are the full power of Google in the Cloud. We are Google Cloud. It’s uniquely Google — a broad set of technologies, solutions and products.”
