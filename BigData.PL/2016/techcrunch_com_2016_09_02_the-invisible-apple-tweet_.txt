The invisible @apple tweet

Here’s a silly thing because it is the ass end of a Friday. Apple just started using the Twitter account —@apple— that they’ve had since 2011. And they’re using it to send out a tweet that promotes the Apple event next week where they’ll introduce new iPhones including a twin lens model with images that rival an SLRs in low light capability, sharpness and depth of field effects.

But the tweet doesn’t appear on the account’s timeline:

How? You may ask.Promoted Tweets, I may answer. The only way Apple can have a tweet floating out in the ether on Twitter without somehow attaching it to its main timeline is a specifically scoped ad buy. They can buy a tweet that exists as an island, basically.

Credit goes to Andy Baio fordiscovering and playing aroundwith this procedure, which some callnullcastingor dark posting and I call Deep Subtweeting, last year. Also credit to Hardbound.co founderNathan Bashawwho alsonoted the funkiness, if not the source of it.

In addition to the Promoted Tweet, Apple has spun up a custom hashtag emoji, which may have set itback a cool million or so. Anyway, if you’re interested in retweeting to get the auto responder, thedirect link to the tweet is here.

Happy Friday. Also Elon Musk sent a memo to Teslaemployees urging them to cut costsand ship as many cars as they can in a bid for profitability. So there is that too.

Update: The auto responder appears to be powered by IC Group

From the looks of it, @icgrouplp is working with Apple, Twitter to power bot experiences. Future Twitter product?https://t.co/PkWaKKxQlS
