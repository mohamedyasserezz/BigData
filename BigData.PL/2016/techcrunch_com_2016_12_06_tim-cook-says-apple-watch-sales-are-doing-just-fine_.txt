Tim Cook says Apple Watch sales are doing just fine

It’s hard to know if the Apple Watch is a hit or a miss. The company doesn’t disclose sales numbers directly, but Tim Cook wanted to react toIDC’s reporton wearables, saying that sales are doing just fine.

According to the report, Apple is only the fourth wearable company now behind Fitbit, Xiaomi and Garmin. It represents a stark 71 percent decline in shipments compared to last year.

But Tim Cook wanted to set the record straight and gavesome information to Reuters. Sales set a record during the first week of holiday shopping. That’s a very specific data point, but I guess it means that Apple had a good week.

Apple also says that the current quarter should be the best ever for the Apple Watch. The Apple Watch seems like a good holiday present, so it seems normal that Apple Watch sales are much higher during the holiday quarter compared to the rest of the year.

Now, people are wondering whether customers are going to renew their existing Apple Watches over the coming years or if they’ll decide it’s not useful enough and they don’t need an Apple Watch in their life. The Apple Watch excitement phase is over. But maybe it’s going to be a slow and boring growth over the coming years.
