Nvidia launches new flagship graphics card, the $1200 Titan X

The latest graphics card release from Nvidia is, in fact, the most powerful card it’s ever produced. With 12 billion transistors, the latest Pascal architecture, 12GB of GDDR5X memory and 3,584 cores at 1.53Ghz delivering an apparent 11 teraflops of performance, it’s a steadfast attempt at being the best there is.

It’s meant for VR, gaming, and basically everything graphically intensive — it will melt what you have in your system like butter, in a second.

Funny enough,Nvidia’s post reads:

“It began with a bet.

Brian Kelleher, our top hardware engineer, bet our CEO, Jen-Hsun Huang, we could get more than 10 teraflops of computing performance from a single chip. Jen-Hsun thought that was crazy.

Well, we did it. The result is crazy. And, as of today, Jen-Hsun now owes Brian a dollar.”

So what you’re telling me is, two executives had a bet and the end result is the most powerful product the company has ever produced? Cool story, guys. Now it’s time for benchmarks.

The new Titan X will be available August 2 for $1,200 direct from nvidia.com in North America and Europe along with select system builders, with a release planned for Asia.
