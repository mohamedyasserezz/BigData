Today is the last day to nominate your favorite startup, founder and technology for a Crunchie!

This is it, friends. Today is the last day for Crunchies nominations. You have until the end of the day to submit who and what you think deserves a Crunchie.

We’re looking for the tech community’s input. Who was the hottest new startup? Who launched the best new technology? Which company had the best launch video? There are 11 categories in all.

This is the 10th anniversary of the Crunchies and we’re thrilled to put the show on again. Like last year, the winners will be decided by a large panel of experts. Called the Crunchies Board, this group includes TechCrunch editors, alongside entrepreneurs, investors and other tech notables, including speakers and judges who have appeared on the Disrupt stage. An independent third-party will administer and tally the ballots, as well as keep the results secret until the awards are announced onstage.

Pleasehead over to the show pageand startnominating your favoritecandidates in the categories provided. Nominations will close on Friday, November 4, 2016.

General admission tickets will be available when the show is a bit closer. We’ll see you at the Crunchies!
