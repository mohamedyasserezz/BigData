Let’s meet in Wroclaw next week

AfterDisrupt in LondonI’ll be heading over to Wroclaw, Poland for a double dose of meet-up fun. The meetups coincided with a few events in Wroclaw and you’re welcome to come to one or both.

The first meetup is part ofImpaceCEEand will be held on Wednesday, December 7. You canRSVP here. It’s primarily Fintech-related but, again, you’re welcome to come along to chat and see the pitches. We’ll be picking startups to pitch.

The second meetup is onFriday, December 9and it’s part of the IN-FERENCE conference. We’ll be talking medtech, biotech, and anything non-fintech related. You can submit anapplication to pitchhere. Please note that unless you hear from me specifically you won’t be guaranteed a spot to pitch.

I’m looking forward to getting back into Poland and I’m especially excited about Wroclaw. I’ve been doing a lot of writing on Central Europe these days in an effort tospread the word about new startups in the regionand things are getting quite interesting. I’ll see you all next week and hopefully we can drain a Zywiec or two.
