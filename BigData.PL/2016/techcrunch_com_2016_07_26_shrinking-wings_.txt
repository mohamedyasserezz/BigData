The new number crushing Twitter: revenue growth down from 60% to 20%

Twitter has a new number that’s killing its share price, down 9.5% in after-hours followinggrim earnings.

Now Twitter is facing atotal revenue growth crisis.

Today it announced its year-over-year revenue growth was just 19.9%, up from $502 million to $602 million. That’s down from its 60.93% revenue growth rate a year ago and 124.12% rate two years ago.
