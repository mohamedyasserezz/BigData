Easythingy launches smart bots, turning your email into a smart travel app

Email was the original killer app for the internet, butEasythingyshows that the decades-old standard still has some life in it. Launched at TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Alley today, the company’s product turns your e-mails into the ultimate travel app.

The app syncs with your e-mail account and picks up keywords from your travels. Airplane tickets, car and hotel bookings, itineraries and everything else turns up into one quick-access screen. Best of all, if you need access to the original e-mails with confirmations, it’s just a tap away.

In addition to making your travel plans easily available, Easythingy puts bills, receipts, confirmation emails and even deliveries at your fingertips, all accessible through the app’s neat and simple interface.

Easythingy also includes the EasyBot chatbot that can help you organize your trip: Book hotels, check into flights and more. The bot will also be able to answer questions you have about your trip. The app looks cool, too, so that’s a delightful bonus!

“The EasyBot makes it fun and easy to book your trip,” says Easythingy CEO Abdul Rehman, but admits that the bot is particularly useful to the company itself. “By opening the doors to bookings and reservations, we improve our business model significantly, as we’re able to take a cut of any bookings.”
