“It’s likely we start to raise more significant amounts of money next year,” Douglas said.

The company, which currently operates in several cities in Texas, is concentrating on reaching out to professionally managed rentals and focusing on marketing to consumers who want to move into newer constructions in larger buildings.

While the company is looking to get into major cities on the east and west coasts, it’s starting to roll out deep in the heart of Texas. “we’re going throughout Texas,” said Douglas. “Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio and then going up through the central U.S.” The next stop, and the one with a rental market closest to either New York or Los Angeles is Chicago, which will be the next port of call for HomeMe’s regional expansion.

“We are dedicated to working with companies that are creating something entirely new, and we see that in HomeMe,” said Mark Siegel, Managing Director, Menlo Ventures. “The way HomeMe has reinvented the apartment rental experience is less stressful, more efficient and is very compelling.”

It’s tough to find an apartment, but good thing there are apps out there that are trying to take at least a little bit of the sting out of the experience.
