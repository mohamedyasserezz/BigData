A look inside Hyperloop One’s wildly fast future

What’s really going on atHyperloop One– the futuristic transportation system proposing to shoot humans from point A to B at 750 miles-per-hour?

The startupchanged its namefrom Hyperloop Transportation to Hyperloop One andbegan testingin the Nevada desert this spring; announced$80 millionin Series B funding; suffered an executiveleadership shake-upand the former co-founder filed a lawsuit; HO thenfileda countersuit; built a demo plant; and announced a possible major shipping operation out of several key areas across the globe, including with a major Russian investment group inMoscowand inDubaiwith DP World – the third largest global shipping company on the planet.

Oh and we’re going to hear from investor and Hyperloop One co-founder Shervin Pishevar on stageat Disruptin a few weeks.

Naturally, we thought it was time to see for ourselves just how close the technology behind the proposed hyperloop is to reality.

Co-founder (and ex-SpaceX engineer)Josh Giegelgave us a sneak peek at what the startup is working on at headquarters. What we saw is something that puts us on the brink of what is sure to change our world and the way we live in the very near future if HO can get its system up to speed.

Check it out for yourselves in the video above to see the beginnings of what may soon be the thing to ship us and all the goods we’ve ordered on Amazon around the world in less than a day.
