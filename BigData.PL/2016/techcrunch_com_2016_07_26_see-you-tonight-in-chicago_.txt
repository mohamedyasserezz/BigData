See you tonight in Chicago

See you tonight! We’ll be meeting at 7pm in theMakeOfficesspace inthe Loop. There will be some free beers and chicken sandwiches. We’ll hold a pitchoff at 8pm and close up at 9pm and perhaps we can go carousing afterwards.

The pitch-off will be very cool. I’ve already picked nine contestants and we have two VC judges. First place winners of the pitch off will get a table at Disrupt SF in September and two other companies will get two tickets each. It will be super great.

Please grab aticket here as space is limitedand please, if you grab a ticket, show up? I’ve kept things smaller on purpose because I’d like quality time with you all.

See you soon!
