Rover announces $40M round for pet sitting and dog walking

Last month, we reported thatRover was closing a $40 million round. Looks like the deal has closed — the pet-sitting startupannouncedtoday that it has raised, yep, $40 million in a Series E funding.

The round was led by Foundry Group and Menlo Ventures, with participation from Madrona Venture Group — all existing investors. Rover has now raised more than $90 million in total funding.

“At Menlo we have been fortunate to back companies like Uber, Siri, Hotmail and Gilead Sciences,” said Menlo managing director Venky Ganesan in the funding release. “Rover is on that trajectory and that’s why we decided to double down and go all in on this investment.”

The company expanded from pet sitting to dog walking last year. It now says that it has more than 65,000 sitters and walkers in its network, and that it’s seeing an average of 1 million bookings each quarter.

Rover says the new funding will be used “to continue redefining the pet care space through product developments, geographical expansion and continued market growth.” It also says the money could be used for acquisitions.
