DraftKings CEO Jason Robins will talk daily fantasy sports at Disrupt SF

Anyone who is interested in sports knows that daily fantasy sports has became the next big thing. And leading the charge isDraftKings, a four-year old technology company that has already raised over $400 million dollars at over a billion dollar valuation.

But it wasn’t an easy ride.

In its short lifespan, DraftKings has already been the center of an FBI and Justice Department investigation, gone head to head with attorneys general and lawmakers in countless U.S states, and been locked in a seemingly infinite spending war with a rival that essentially offers the exact same service.

And now atTechCrunch Disrupt SFwe get to sit down with DraftKings co-founder and CEO Jason Robins to hear exactly how he’s continued to grow his company while navigating it through a pretty crazy series of events.

We’ll also ask Robins how he was able to score investments from some of the biggest names in sports like New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and Major League Baseball.

And, most importantly, we’ll talk to Robins about the future of his company and the entire industry, and if he thinks we’ll ever live in a world where daily fantasy sports is legal in all 50 states.

Tickets are still available. We hope you can make it out to the event this September.
