Nintendo says it will preview the Nintendo NX tomorrow

At long last, it seems like Nintendo is ready to talk about their next gaming console.

Nintendo hasn’t said much about the upcoming gaming platform to date, beyond confirming the “Nintendo NX” codename, calling it a “brand-new concept”, and promising that it would be released in March 2017.

According to a tweetfrom Nintendo’s official Twitter account, though, they’re about to shed some light on things:

Be among the first to discover#NX. Watch the Preview Trailer at 7am PT/10am ET!pic.twitter.com/R2QTzjyLUo

Now, lets just hope this “preview” is in fact more of apreviewand less of a (painfully short and detail-light) “teaser”.

Though the tweet doesn’t specify where the trailer will go live, a splash page that just went up onNintendo.comconfirms it’ll be there.
