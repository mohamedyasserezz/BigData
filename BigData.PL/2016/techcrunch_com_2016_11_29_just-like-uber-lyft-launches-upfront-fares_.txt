Just like Uber, Lyft launches upfront fares

Lyft is launching upfront fares so that passengers won’t get any surprises once the ride ends. Although Lyft had previously offered fare estimates, you’ll now be able to know exactly how much you’ll have to pay. The feature was previously available for Lyft Line riders.

To get the upfront fare, all you have to do is put in your final destination. The total price you’ll see will include all fees, taxes, tolls, Prime Time and promotions.

Uber, which launched upfront fares in June, has received some flack for this because, over time,it started to obscure how much passengers were paying for surge pricing. Same goes for Lyft. You’ll only be able to see Prime Time if you choose not to get a price upfront.*

In October,a study came outsuggesting that Uber and Lyft drivers respectively discriminate against passengers. The National Bureau of Economic Research found that black people have to wait longer for rides in Seattle. The researchers ultimately recommended, among other things, that Uber and Lyft implement upfront fares.

Uber had already done that, but Lyft did not until now. Lyft says the update has nothing to do with the recommendations from the NBER.

*An earlier version of this article said Lyft would show you the exact breakdown of the fare in your receipt. Lyft has since said it made a mistake when we first spoke, and that the Prime Time fee will not show up in your receipt.
