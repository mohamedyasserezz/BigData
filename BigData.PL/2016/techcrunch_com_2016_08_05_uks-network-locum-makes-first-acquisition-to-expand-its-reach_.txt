UK’s Network Locum makes first acquisition to expand its reach

U.K. startupNetwork Locum, which has built a staffing platform and workplace management software targeting the U.K.’s National Health Service, has acquired a smaller locum GP-booking platform, Leicester-basedRLocums, which operates across the East Midlands. The price for the acquisition has not been disclosed.

RLocums, which was founded back in 2011, has around 3,000 doctors signed up to its regional marketplace — boosting the overall tally of temps in Network Locum’s national database (as of last month the latter said it had 40,000 registered sign-ups and 5,000 active users).

It’s Network Locum’s first acquisition and follows the closing of a$7 million Series B round last month, led by U.K. fundBGF Ventures— feeding a stated strategy of unifying locum booking needs across the U.K. onto a single platform.

That said, Network Locum is not planning to change RLocums’ operations — with the latter business set to continue to operate under its own name, with its own business model and website, post-acquisition.

But this is really about beefing up a central database of potential customers and staff to expand cross-selling opportunities for its workplace management SaaS behind whatever front door locum booking systems Network Locum ends up owning.
