The Amazon Echo gains MLB Gameday Audio just in time for the World Series

The MLB just made it a bit easier to listen to the Indians destroy the Cubs during the World Series. After enabling the skill, subscribers to MLB products just need to tell an Echo to ask MLB to play the Indians. And like that, the Echo turns into your personal Bob Uecker, streaming the play-by-play directly into your room.

The app will work the same way during the next season, a MLB spokesperson tells TechCrunch. Fans with a subscription can listen to any live game radio broadcast during Spring Training, the regular season and Postseason without blackouts.

To have access to this ability, listeners need to subscribe to MLB.com At Bat Premium, MLB.TV or Gameday Audio.

This is the MLB’s first integration with the Amazon Echo and the ability hits just in time for the 2016 World Series, which will of course be over in four games after the Indians crush Chicago’s hopes and dreams and bring another championship home to Cleveland this year.
