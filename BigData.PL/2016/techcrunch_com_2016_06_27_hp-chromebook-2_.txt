HP’s new Chromebook offers up to 12.5 hours of battery life and starts at $189

HP is working hard to make a strong Chromebook case for consumers looking for a secondary – or even tertiary – laptop, featuring some upgraded specs at rock bottom prices.

Following on the heels of theChromebook 13 announced back in April, the company’s justrevealed the Chromebook 11 G5, a new Chrome OS notebook with some noteworthy features, including, most compelling, a $189 starting price.

The entry-level device features a 11.6-inch touchscreen and weighs in at 2.51 pounds. Inside is an Intel Celeron N3060 processor promising up to 11 hours of life with the touchscreen enabled – or 12.5, if it’s turned off.

The G5 also features a newly designed chassis designed to be both thin and light and more rugged (coupled with a Gorilla Glass display), a feature aimed at both frequent travelers and students, the latter of which has been a particular focus among Chromebook makers in recent years.

The newly announced Chromebook is set for release through HP partners in July, with in-store availability following in October.
