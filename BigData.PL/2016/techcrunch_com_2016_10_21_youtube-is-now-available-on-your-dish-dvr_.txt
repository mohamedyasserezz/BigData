YouTube is now available on your Dish DVR

YouTube, everyone’s favorite source for Adele lyric videos andASMR-inducing paper crinkles, is joining Netflix and other on-demand services on theDish Hopper 3 DVR. The service will appear on channel 371 and as a standalone “app” in the main menu.

You can also send videos to your DVR via the YouTube mobile app, ensuring that you can show everyone Charlie the Unicorn as soon as they get a little too drunk to argue yet still aren’t drunk enough to get rowdy.

The Hopper 3 also supports Netflix, Pandora, Vevo, and Weather Channel channel apps. The move to add YouTube is a fairly obvious one. It’s probably technically negligible to support the app and YouTube keeps folks glued to the TV where, presumably, the will eventually get tired of funniest dash cam videos and click over to CNN.
