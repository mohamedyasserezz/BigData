Gillmor Gang: Foot Traffic

[tc_unified_video code=”57a60bc776a6053a10324ff0″]

The Gillmor Gang — Keith Teare, Frank Radice, Kevin Marks, and Steve Gillmor. Recorded live Friday, August 5, 2016. The Gang is polled on Google’s AMP attack on the Web, the percentage of time on desktop vs mobile, and whether deep linking on Apple TV represents the new binge in media. Oh, and Trump meets FourSquare walk-in data on the latest G3 (below) with Mary Hodder, Halley Suitt Tucker, Francine Hardaway, and Tina Chase Gillmor.
