Canon presents strong case with the EOS 5D Mark IV’s 30.4MP sensor and 4K

One of the most beloved camera series out there, the Canon EOS Mark 5D was due for a refresh. Announced today,Mark IVof the EOS 5D brings a 30.4 megapixel full frame sensor with 4K video capability, so this is truly an elite camera. Some of the specifications that have come to our attention include a full-frame 30.4 megapixel CMOS sensor with ISO range 100–32,000; still expandable up to 50–102,400.

Being a camera that’s suitable for many different shooting scenarios, Canon included specs such as 7 fps continuous shooting, a 3.2-inch touch screen and WiFi capabilities.

For the first time on a EOS 5D, Canon included 4K video recording at 30fps, while 1080p HD at 60 fps remains as a staple feature. Canon cameras are well-known for their video capabilities, and if put through its paces, can produce shoots of merit — I’d have to evaluate Mark IV, of course.

Perhaps some of the most interested additions to the EOS 5D is going to be the 61-pointAF system,which is insane to even think of. Paired with dual pixel focusing technology (the same tech licensed to Samsung for its Galaxy S7 family of cameras). Meanwhile, Canon’sDIGIC 6+Image processor runs the show with a stunning 150,000-pixel RGB+IR metering sensor.

It’ll come out in September for $3,499, body-only. If a lens kit is more to your fancy, then Canon will eventuality sell you a EF24-70mm f/4L lens for $4,399 early next month, or with a EF24-105mm f/4L IS II USM lens for $4,599 in late October.
