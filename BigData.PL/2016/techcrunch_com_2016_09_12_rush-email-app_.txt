Email or IM? Rush’s app combines them both — with productivity tools thrown in too

Email? IM? IM? Email? The rise of mobile messaging apps has challenged email as the primary communications channel for all things, including work — what happens when you blend them together?

That’s the approach taken byRush, an app that combines email and messaging, but also includes your calendar and other productivity tools. Headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, but with offices worldwide, the app launch two months ago and a Mac version is in the works, too.

Rush co-founder Jo Lau discussed the app with us at TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco, where Rush is one of the exhibitors in the Startup Alley section.

Rush is available foriOSandAndroid.
