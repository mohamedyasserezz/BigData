AOL’s Tim Armstrong and Verizon’s Marni Walden are coming to Disrupt SF

AOL CEO Tim Armstrong isno stranger to the stage at Disrupt, but his job’s gotten a lot bigger in recent months withthe acquisition of Yahoo.

So Armstrong will be with us again at Disrupt SF. He’ll be joined by his boss Marni Walden, Verizon’s executive vice president and president of product innovation and new business. The two of them ledVerizon’s effort to buy Yahooand are now handling the process of integrating the companies. (Verizon owns AOL, while AOL owns TechCrunch.)

Iinterviewed Armstrong about the dealshortly after it was announced, but at the time, he said many of the plans were still being worked out. At Disrupt, he and Walden should have a better idea of what Verizon, AOL and Yahoo will look like together.

They can also speak more broadly about Verizon’s efforts to get into the digital media business with products likethe go90 mobile video appand big bets likereality TV showThe Runner.
