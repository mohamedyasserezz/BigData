Forerunner Ventures ups the ante with a new, third fund

Forerunner Ventures, an early-stage, San Francisco-based venture firm that focuses almost exclusively on e-commerce businesses, has raised a $122 million fund, shows anSEC filingthat was filed earlier this morning.

The firm was founded by Kirsten Green, who is listed on the filing along with Eurie Kim, a partner who joined the firm in 2012.

The all-female firm also features an operating principal, Melissa Grillo Aruz, and associate Nicole Johnson.

Green, an equity research analyst who followed the specialty retail sector earlier in her career, didn’t respond to an interview request of earlier today.

The firm’s newest fund is its third, and it’s a sizable step up from Forerunner’s previous $55.5 million fund, which was reportedlycapped at $75 million. It’s also three times bigger than the firm’s first institutional fund, which closed with$40 millionin 2012.

Some of the firm’s many bets include the online and offline eyewear retailerWarby Parker, which was reportedlyconsidering filing for an IPOlast year but remains privately held;Bonobos, another retailer that makes men’s clothes and has been extensively written about as apre-IPO candidate; and Dollar Shave Club, a four-year-old, subscription service for razors and other men’s toiletries that says it’s on target toturn profitablethis year.

Many of the firm’s bets remain too young to have exited just yet, though one, Shuddle, a two-year-old transportation platform that was widely billed as an Uber for children,shut down in Aprilafter failing to raise follow-on funding.
