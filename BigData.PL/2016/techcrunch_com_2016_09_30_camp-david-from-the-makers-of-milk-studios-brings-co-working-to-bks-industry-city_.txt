Camp David, from the makers of Milk Studios, brings co-working to BKâ€™s Industry City

Brooklynites looking for a place to build their wares now have yet another option in the form of Camp David.

Camp David comes to us via Milk Studios founders Mazdack Rassi and Erez Shternlicht, who have experience in bringing this type of space to life in the studio production world. With Camp David, they hope to expand that footprint into other creative verticals including tech.

Camp David, located in Industry City, offers an assortment of packages, including private offices up to six people to assigned desks in open space to floating desks, which can be purchased when needed.

The space also comes with a gym, a cafe, a general store, a copy center, private call rooms and conference rooms, tech support, a kitchen, and 24/7 access and security. Plus, Camp David offers a platinum fiber internet connection.

Private spaces start at $800/month per desk, and assigned desks in open space cost $550/month. Part-time pros who want to stop on by to get some work done can get a floating desk as low as $40/day.
