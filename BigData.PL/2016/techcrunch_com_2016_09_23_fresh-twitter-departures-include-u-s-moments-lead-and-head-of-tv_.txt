Fresh Twitter departures include U.S. Moments lead and head of TV

Rumors are swirling about potential acquirers for Twitter right now, but meanwhile the company is still seeing departures in some key staffing areas. Twitter’s head of TV Andrew Adashek, and its North American Moments curation team lead Marcus Mabry have both departed the company.

Mabry has been hired by CNN, after a year spent at Twitter managing the Moments product for U.S. and Canadian users, according to a release by the news network. Mabry joined Twitter from the New York Times, where he was the newspaper’s mobile editor.

Adashek notes via Twitter that after his last day today, he’ll be “taking some time off” to “see what’s next.” Prior to joining Twitter in 2012, Adashek was a digital Producer forThe Voice, and then briefly helped with the social team at the Emmy Awards before joining up with the blue bird. Adashek is regarded asinstrumental in Twitter’s TV ambitions, from its key role as a second-screen discussion destination for big televised events like Emmys, through its current efforts to unseat traditional TV as a vector for live streaming video of sports, news and more.

Both Adashek and Mabry’s departure come on the same day that rumors are swirling about Twitter’s potential acquisition, with companies including Salesforce and Twitter reportedly interested inpicking up the social network according to CNBC. But Twitter has also seen a fairly steady stream of departures from people in key roles over the last year or so, especially since Jack Dorsey replaced Dick Costolo as the company’s CEO in 2015.
