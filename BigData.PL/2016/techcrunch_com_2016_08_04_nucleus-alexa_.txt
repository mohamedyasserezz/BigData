Nucleus’ smart intercom adds Alexa functionality

Amazon’s friendly AI is continuing its brisk march across smart home services. A week afterAugust announced Alexa functionalityfor its smart lock,Nucleusis doing the same for itshome intercom system, a rare feat for a touchscreen device.

The family focused smart intercom system, which starts shipping today, features a front-facing HD camera, a built-in microphone and speakers that are designed for both conversing and streaming music. It also works with an iOS and Android app, making it possible to check in on the device remotely.

Alexa integration, meanwhile, brings a slew of different non-intercom functionality to the connected device. Users can ask the Nucleus to check on the weather, add items to the grocery list and stream songs through Prime Music, iHeartRadio and TuneIn — pretty standard Alexa fare, really.

The intercom runs $249 and is available as of today through Amazon and at Lowe’s retail locations.
