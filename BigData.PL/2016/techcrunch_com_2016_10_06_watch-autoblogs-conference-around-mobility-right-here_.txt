With Cruise and Waze and Uber and Comma and Otto and Tesla and all the rest, it’s clear that the automotive world is on the edge of a dramatic cliff. Things are about to change and fast. It’s why we heavily featured mobility companies a few weeks back at TechCrunch Disrupt SF. And it’s why Aol’s Autoblog is holding their first conference around the topic, too.

The event is embedded live here and runs on October 6th from 9:00am to 5:00pm Detroit time. Theagenda is solidwith panels, fireside chats and demos. The day ending with Detroit mogul Dan Gilbert taking the stage where he’ll likely make a pitch for startups to move to Detroit.
