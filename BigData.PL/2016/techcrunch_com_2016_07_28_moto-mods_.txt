Motorola opens its Moto Z modular system to hardware developers

Motorola – or, perhaps more accurately, Verizon – has started selling themodular Moto Z and Moto Z Force Droid Editionstoday (starting at $624 and $720, respectively), along with the JBL SoundBoost Speaker, Insta-Share Projector and Incipio offGRID battery pack backings.

That’s a decent start for accessories (better thanLG’s G5, without question), but in order for Motorola to truly cement its modular future, the company is going to have to have some serious third-party developer participation. Along with the new hardware, the Lenovo-owned handset maker hasstarted selling the Moto Mod developer kit.

The $125 kit includes a reference Mod, a cover and a Perforated Board, which features an 80-pin connector, designed to develop third-party accessories that snap onto and work with the handset. The phone maker has also launched anonline developer portalfor reference and announced plans to invest $1 million to help bring some of the accessories to market.
