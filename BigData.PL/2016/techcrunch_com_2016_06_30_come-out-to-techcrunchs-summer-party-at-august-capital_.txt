Come out to TechCrunch’s Summer Party at August Capital

TheTechCrunch Summer Partyis a thing of tradition and we hope you can make it out this year. Like in years past we’ll gather on the spacious grounds of August Capital in Menlo Park and enjoy an evening of cocktails and the spirit of entrepreneurship.

Tickets are very limited and released on a rolling basis. It’s $85 to attend and $1000 to exhibit your startup at a demo table.

About the Summer Party at August Capital

TechCrunch parties have a history of being the place you want to meet your future investor, acquirer or co-founder. Case in point, when TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington used to hold these events in his Atherton backyard, Box founders Aaron Levie and Dylan Smith met one of their first investors, DFJ. And in 2010, we spotted 500 Startups’ Dave McClure writing a check to then-stealthy startup Tello, which was bought by Urban Airship.

Hope to see you all there this year!
