Among science fiction films, Luc Besson’s 1997 epicThe Fifth Elementenjoys special status as a classic that’s unique among others in the category, with an indulgent, artistic flair and beautiful set pieces that differ dramatically from the more drab and worn environs of movies like Star Wars and Blade Runner.Valerian and the city of a Thousand Planets, Besson’s upcoming sci-fi film based on a successful graphic novel, looks like it will boast a strong, similar signature style.

I don’t want to put the cart ahead of the horse here, but it’s going to be great and we’re all going to love it so much.
