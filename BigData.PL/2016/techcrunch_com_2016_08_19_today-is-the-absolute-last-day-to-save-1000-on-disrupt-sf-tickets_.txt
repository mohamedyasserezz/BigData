Today is the last day to save $1,000 on Disrupt SF tickets

Okay, you’ve procrastinated long enough, startup fans. If you somehow haven’t yet gotten your tickets to the hottest startup show in the Bay Area, today is the day to do it. It’s the final day to getDisrupt SF 2016tickets at our early-bird price point of $1,995 apiece, a full $1,000 cheaper than those same tickets will be tomorrow.

What will your ticket get you? For starters, you’ll get to check out the incredible startups in theStartup Battlefield competition, an event in which promising early-stage startups take to the stage to pitch their products and services to our panel of judges in the hopes of winning $50,000 and the coveted Disrupt Cup.

Then, you’ll wander around the show floor as you chat with hundreds of entrepreneurs and their companies in Startup Alley and Hardware Alley, learn about all sorts of things fromthe lineup of incredible speakerswe’ve scheduled for a series of interviews and fireside chats throughout the conference.

Finally, after the end of a long day on the show floor, what better way to unwind  than by checking out the after-parties that keep the good times rolling long after the show floor has closed for the night?

Your early-bird ticket is your all-access pass to everything that’s great about Disrupt, and today is the last day to get your hands on these deeply-discounted tickets before the prices is going to jump by $1,000 tomorrow.

Disrupt SF 2016 takes place September 12-14 at San Francisco’s Pier 48, just down the street from the beautiful AT&T Park. We can’t wait to see you all there.
