Berlin — you have a few more days to apply for our Pitch Off next month!

Quick note to say we’re extending applications for our Berlin Meet Up + Pitch Off which is taking place next month — so you now have until June 25 to fill outthis formfor the chance to pitch your startup on stage and impress our panel of judges.

We’ll have around 10 startups pitching at the event, with prizes for the winner, runner-up and audience choice — in the form of a place at Startup Alley at TC Disrupt London this December, or two tickets to the show, or one ticket, respectively.

Pitches are a rapid fire 60 seconds, followed by a short Q&A with the judges. So no time for slides.

The Meet Up + Pitch Off will take place in Berlin’s Glashaus on the evening of July 14. Attendee tickets can be boughthere(for €10).

Our partner for the event is the Tech Open Air conference — see below for more details on TOA.
