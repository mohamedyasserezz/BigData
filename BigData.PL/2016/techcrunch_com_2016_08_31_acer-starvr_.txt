Acer has started shipping its StarVR headsets for use at the first IMAX VR center

StarVR made a small splash at last year’s E3 when it demoed its new high-end headset. Just ahead of this year’s gaming show, the company announced thatit would be joining forces with Acerto collaborate on the designing and manufacturing of the amusement park-ready hardware.

Today at IFA, the companies announced that the first devices have begun shipping –specifically to IMAX, which plans to utilize them for its upcoming Los Angeles-based IMAX VR Center. This initial shipment is the first phase of a larger planned roll out announced by the companies earlier this year.

Mass production of the ultra-wide angle viewing headsets is set to begin in full force in 2017. The StarVR headset features a 5,120 x 1,440 resolution (compare to the Rift and Vive’s 2,160 x 1,200), with a 210-degree field of view, versus those headsets’ 110.

The Los Angeles location is the first of several VR Centers from IMAX. The company currently has a half-dozen international locations in the works, with plans to expand into China as well.
