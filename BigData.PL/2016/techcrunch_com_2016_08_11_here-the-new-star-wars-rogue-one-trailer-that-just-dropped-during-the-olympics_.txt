Heres the new Star Wars: Rogue One trailer that just dropped during the Olympics

Whoaaa. While most newStar Warstrailers tend to drop in the wee hours of the morning, Disney just blasted one out right as most people on the east coast were prepping for bed. Thanks, Olympics!

Here’s the second trailer forRogue One, the first of Disney’s spinoff/origin movies, which is coming out on December 16th — or a little more than four months from now.

—— If you’re not watching the trailer but for some reason clicked into this post, heads up: spoilers/trailer discussion from here on out ——

I’m not going to dothe GIF-by-GIF teardownlike we’ve done with previous trailers because that seems alittlesilly for a prequel (IT WAS TOTALLY NOT SILLY BEFORE, SHH). Instead, my second-by-second thoughts while watching:

0:07: Hey! That’s Saw Gerrera (played by Forest Whitaker), a resistance leader. He’s not new to Star Wars canon — he appeared, albeit much more animated and much less Forest Whitakered, in the Clone Wars series — but he’s new to the movies. Most people won’t know him going into this.

0:30: This is Disney’s subtle way of saying “this is a prequel” without putting the word “prequel” anywhere near this one.

1:03: New robot! That’s K-2SO (not K-250 as people have been getting wrong). He reminds me of a mashup of C-3PO and the2-1B droidthat patches up Luke inEmpire.

1:24: “NEVER TELL ME THE ODDS!”

1:25: Oh hey, wouldn’t you know, EA is alreadyworking on the Star Wars Battlefront Rogue One expansion.

1:34: DEAR EA PLEASE LET ME SHOOT AT-ATs WITH A ROCKET LAUNCHER THANKS

1:39: Hyperdrive in the trailer? That seems like something they could’ve left for a theater-audience-loses-it OH SHIT moment.

1:51: Oh, guess it’s over

1:54: OH MAN IT’S NOT OVER IT’S NOT OVER
