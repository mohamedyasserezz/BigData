Opera brings its free VPN service to Android

Earlier this year, Operalaunchedits free and unlimited VPN service for iOS; today it is bringing the same functionalityto Android. Like the iOS version, the Android app is based on Opera’sacquisition of SurfEasy in 2015and allows you to surf safely when you are on a public network.

While Opera’s marketing mostly focuses on safety, Opera VPN also allows you to appear as if you are in the U.S., Canada, Germany, Singapore and The Netherlands, so it’s also a way to route around certain geo-restrictions without having to opt for a paid service.

In addition to its VPN features, the service also allows you to block ad trackers. Somewhat ironically, though, the app itself will show you some pretty unintrusive ads.

“The Opera VPN app for Android sets itself apart from other VPNs by offering a completely free service­ without a data limit, no log­in required, advanced Wi­Fi protection features and no need for a subscription,” says Chris Houston, the president of Opera’s SurfEasy VPN division, in today’s announcement.

Setting Opera VPN ip only take a few seconds. The app itself handles setting up your Android VPN settings, so you don’t have to delve into the settings menu yourself.

In addition to its core service, the app also lets you see how safe your current Wi-Fi connection is. It allows you to run a Wi-Fi security test and shows you potential issues. Unsurprisingly, it’ll likely show you that using a VPN is going to be more secure than simply connecting to the internet directly.

You will likely notice a small speed decrease once you turn on this feature, but that’s to be expected. In testing the Android version, those changes were occasionally noticeable, but never a deal breaker.
