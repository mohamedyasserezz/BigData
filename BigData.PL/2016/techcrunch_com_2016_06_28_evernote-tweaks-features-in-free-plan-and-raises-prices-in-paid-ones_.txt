Evernote tweaks features in free plan and raises prices in paid ones

Evernoteis an indispensable tool for many, and the company is always working on making it more so — “but that requires a significant investment of energy, time, and money,”it writes in a new blog post. You know what that means: price hikes.

The Basic tier remains free, of course (and will stay free forever, the post insists), but is now limited to only two devices. That might be sufficient for the average user — Evernote likely wouldn’t deliberately rankle a majority of their free users — but it’s still a considerable limitation. The addition of the passcode lock feature to Basic helps soften the blow, though. You only get 60MB of space per month, which definitely will fill up fast.

Plus, which was $3 per month, now costs $4 (or $35 per year), while Premium went from $6 to $8 per month, or $70 per year. You get 1GB and 10GB, respectively, in those plans, and the specifics of what’s offered (too much to list here) can be found at theEvernotesite.

The increased pricing may cause some short-term frustration and a few people jumping ship, but as many of us have found, a service that works for us and into which we’ve poured years of data is generally worth keeping around, even if it increases in price by a few bucks. If Google had offered us the chance to pay $30 per year to keep Reader alive, you better believe they would have had a few takers!
