Ciao, I’m Lucia Maffei, the newest writing intern at TechCrunch

Hi, I’m Lucia, and I’m the the newest TechCrunch summer writing intern.

I’m going to write from Chicago – please note the standard Windy City hairstyle in the above pic – where I’m also a graduate student of Journalism at Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism.

I came to the U.S. to study business reporting and data visualization after a five-year career as a freelance reporter in Italy. My interest in technology was spurred by the document preparation system LaTeX, which instantly replaced Microsoft Word on the bottom right corner of my laptop. At TC, I’m planning on covering smartphones, the Internet of Things, coding and startups, as well as photography gear.

Even though I was born and raised in Tuscany, my cooking skills need improvement. However, my espresso-making skills are widely appreciated. In my free time, I enjoy reading Stephen King’s novels, playing table tennis and experimenting with infographics online tools.

Please feel free to reach me atlucia.maffei@beta.techcrunch.com. I’m also a compulsiveTwitteruser and a photojournalist and landscape photographer in-the-making onInstagram.
