Netflix lands on Google’s Daydream VR

Daydream got along list of new apps and services last week, including HBO Now, but Netflix was listed only as “coming soon.” Now, theNetflix VR app has arrived, as a separate, standalone app that works with Daydream VR headsets, including the Google Daydream View.

The VR version of Netflix for Daydream looks very similar to the one that was previously available for Samsung’s Gear VR, which is not surprising, given that it’s probably easy to leverage tech built for that for Google’s own virtual reality platform. Basically, it puts you in a simulated cabin with a big screen TV for your Netflix watching pleasure.

Unfortunately, as of this writing, it doesn’t appear to support offline downloads, since the app is separate from the main mobile Netflix app for Android, and you also have to sign in separately. Hopefully this is coming in a future update, since it would be great to strap this thing on during a transatlantic flight and just binge like it’s the end of the world and you’re all alone in your mountain-top chalet.
