Motorola ‘likely’ to launch a Project Tango module for the Moto Z

Slowly but surely the Moto Z is getting an ecosystem. The promising handset launched with some solid specs and a handful of add-ons that made it the most fully formed modular handset to date — which, granted, isn’t saying a whole heck of a lot.

And Motorola’s been working to add to those offerings by opening up its Mods to developers and even launching a handful of hackathon designs to bring functionality to the back of the handset.

At an event in Chicago this week, the company’s president Aymar de Lencquesaingtold the pressthat the Z handsets are “likely to have a Tango module.” A little wishy-washy perhaps — and certainly short of a full-on announcement — but it’s a partnership that makes sense.

After all, Motorola’s parent, Lenovo was the first to really embrace Google’s augmented reality camera technology in the form of its Phab 2 Pro [pictured]. And while Tango in its current form isn’t a strong enough platform to be the deciding factor in the purchase of a handset, it could work well as another add-on for the versatile phone.

Housing it as a module would also go a ways to addressing the additional hardware (additional cameras, more battery) to really power the indoor 3D mapping software. It could also help secure the Moto Z’s place as a platform for hardware experimentation in ways that just aren’t possible on the current two-year smartphone upgrade cycle.
