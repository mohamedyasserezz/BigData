Glitzy watch manufacturer MB&F announces the Balthazar clockwork robot

Today in Part 23 of our series entitled Goofy Rich-Person Gadgetry, we present the MB&F Balthazar, a posable robot that tells the time and has a “dark side.” First, a little context. This is basically a “novelty” designed by a watchmaker to sell to rich people. It’s entirely hand made and features an exposed mechanism and dual dials that tell the time.

I’ll let MB&F explain themselves:

By “dark side” they mean you can twist his jolly head to display a leering skull face, which makes it just the thing to scare your cat.

The fact that this clock runs for 35 days on one winding and that he has a little regulator wheel in his head are kind of the high-tech draw here. Getting a clock of this size to last that long is no mean feat, and fitting all the geegaws and whatnots into such a small package is pretty cool. While it can’t shoot lasers or scare your cat (much), it can look cool on your big, dark wooden desk next to the scalps of your sworn enemies.

The Balthazar joins theArachnophobiain the MB&F weird robot family. It costs $52,875.
