Peek inside Brooklyn’s first Apple Store

Apple is opening its very first store in Brooklyn tomorrow. TechCrunch got a sneak peek at the new spot during a press event earlier this week, as you can see in the video above.

The store isn’t quite as grand as some of Apple’s other New York locations, but it has an appropriately Brooklyn-y feel, with plenty of exposed brick, concrete floors and a timber ceiling. The company also says it has restored the building’s original facade.

The Brooklyn location incorporates elements of the new Apple Store design thatthe company unveiled in San Francisco earlier this year, including a central “forum” area with a 6K video screen. And there’s no separate Genius Bar area, because the geniuses (a.k.a tech support) will now be dispersed throughout the floor.

The store is located in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg neighborhood and opens for the first time at 10am on Saturday, July 30. (A Whole Foods opened across the street just a few days ago, which is surely a sign of something.)

The company also says it will be openinga World Trade Center storein just a few weeks.
