Mophie’s modular case brings everything but a headphone jack to the iPhone 7

Of late, Mophie seems to be intent on letting the world know that it’s more than just charging cases – but hey, at the end of the day, there are worse things to be than virtually synonymous with a given space. And hey, when Apple unveiled its first proprietary charging case a year or so back, everyone was quick to drop the hardware startup’s name like it was going out of style.

The company’s latest offering splits the difference – taking a note from Otterbox’s most recent play with a modular phone case that brings a slew of swappable functionality to the back of the iPhone 7. In hindsight, it’s pretty clear why Mophie opted not to become one of the uniVERSE’s third-party accessory providers.

Unlike Otterbox’s offering, Mophie’s gone magnetic (a la the Moto Z and its various offshoots) with theHold Force, with plates built into the two base cases. As of now, there are three accessories, a 4,000mAh battery (naturally) that features a swappable microUSB/lightning port for charging, along with folio and wallet cases for carrying around credit cards and the like.

It’s a pretty small selection at the moment, but hopefully Mophie will look toward third-party partners to expand the ecosystem further. Meantime, all of the above offerings are available through Mophie’s site. The base cases run $40, the battery is $50 and the folio and wallet are $20 a pop.
