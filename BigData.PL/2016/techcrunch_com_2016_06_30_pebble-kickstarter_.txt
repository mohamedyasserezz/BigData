“We couldn’t be prouder to demonstrate the crowdfunding model works,” said Eric Migicovsky, CEO at Pebble. “We’re thrilled at the success of our third campaign and are thankful for all the support we’ve received.”

We hadan early look at the new productswhen the campaign first launched, and it looks like Pebble’s audiences responded with great enthusiasm, much like for its previous record-smashing Kickstarter campaigns.

The first Pebble campaign was noteworthy as it put both the company and Kickstarter itself on the map for many people, andwith an impressive $10.3 million campaign, it set the bar for the crowdfunding industry as a whole. When the company returned for round two, it doubled its previous recordwith a beefy $20.3 million campaign for Pebble Time, launched strategically to try and steal some of the wind out of Apple’s sails; the campaign launched between the announcement and shipping dates for Apple Watch.
