Kickstarter is pulling back the curtain on its app development process. This morning, the crowdfunding platform istaking to its engineering blogto announce that it will be open sourcing the code for its native Android and iOS apps, in keeping with the company’s goal of giving startups a bit of a leg up.

According to the company, inspiration for the idea arrived around the same timeit became a Public Benefit Corporation, in September of last year, playing into that larger idea of giving something back to the larger development community.

The code will be made available starting today through the company’s Github repo, giving interested parties access to the process behind the work that goes into engineering and designing of the apps.
