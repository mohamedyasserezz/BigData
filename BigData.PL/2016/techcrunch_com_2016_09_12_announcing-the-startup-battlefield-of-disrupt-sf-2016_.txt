Announcing The Startup Battlefield Of Disrupt SF 2016

TechCrunch is pleased to announce the 23 startups selected to participate in the Disrupt SF 2016Startup Battlefield. Over the next three days, these companies will compete on tech’s biggest stage for $50,000 and the coveted Disrupt Cup.

The Battlefield represents the crème de la crème; the startups onstage represent just over 2.5 percent of those that applied. Startup Battlefield serves to showcase the most promising early-stage and, dare we say, disruptive startups in the industry. And this batch does not disappoint.

These companies will be helping gamers grow their skills, sequencing RNA, capturing 360 video, repairing your hacked code, bringing blood tests into your home, enabling distributed manufacturing and making your food safer. And of course, there will be robots.

Battlefield startups hail from right here in the Bay Area and across the country – Austin, Oakland, Brooklyn and even Evanston, IL. A few traveled a little further to join us – from Canada, France, Hong Kong and Lebanon.

Over the past month, these startups have been working tirelessly to prepare to launch, rushing to finalize designs, and produce that final prototype. They spent time with TechCrunch staff to hone their pitches to a crisp six minutes. All this work pays off when each startup faces off against an impressive lineup of judges during their live Q&A session.

Only a few selected finalists will have a chance to present once more on Wednesday this time, with $50,000 and the Disrupt Cup on the line.

TheStartup Battlefield hubcontains all details of the event, including the schedule, judge bios and more information on the companies. The pitches will begin, and be streamed live, starting at 2:25 p.m. PDT today and tomorrow.

Battlefield companies will also be showcasing in the Startup Alley all three days of the conference. Stop by and see what all the fuss is about!
