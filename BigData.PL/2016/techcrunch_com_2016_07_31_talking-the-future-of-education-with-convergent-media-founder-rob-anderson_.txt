Talking the future of education with Convergent Media founder Rob Anderson

This week on Technotopia I talk to Rob Anderson, founder ofConvergent Media Groupand a former founding team member at MTV Russia. Anderson has some interesting ideas on education and the necessity for a true way to assess and hire based on personality types and skills.

Anderson is constantly hiring for his media company and he’s looking forward to a future when we will all be working a few hours a week at jobs perfectly suited for our aptitudes. While personality is a bit difficult to pin down, talent and skill can be measured and you can be placed on an educational track the could make you more than happy. The mission, then, is the sci-fi-like notion that humans are not one-size-fits-all and that smarter systems will slot us into exactly the right place at the right time.

Incidentally, if you’re looking for something a bit funnier and a lot raunchier (NSFW language), I’d encourage you to visit with Rich “Lowtax” Kyanka, founder ofSomethingAwful. I didn’t get much about the future out of him but he was funny.
