GM testing Cruise’s self-driving tech with Bolt EVs on Arizona roads

GM is putting itsCruise acquisitionto good use in Arizona: The self-driving car startup acquired by the automaker in March is trialling its tech on public roads in Scottsdale. Cruise tweeted about the autonomous testing expansion, which uses Chevrolet Bolt all-electric vehicles, and which adds to the core fleet of testing vehicles already operating in San Francisco.

Cruise’s self-driving Bolt hit San Francisco streets in May, but provided few details beyond acknowledging that it was doing testing. GM has aggressive goals in terms of productizing its Cruise acquisition, however: The Wall Street Journal reported that GM hopes to put self-driving taxis into usage tests in partnership with Lyft “within a year.”

Scottsdale makes sense for a field test, since the area already plays host to Google self-driving cars, and the state has strong regulatory support for self-driving vehicle tests in general. GM’s Innovation Center is also based in nearby Chandler.

GM confirmed the Arizona tests but isn’t providing any more information about this time.
