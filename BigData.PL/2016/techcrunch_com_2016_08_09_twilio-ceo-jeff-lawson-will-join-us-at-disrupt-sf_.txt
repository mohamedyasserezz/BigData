Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson will join us at Disrupt SF

At Disrupt London last year, I sat down with Twilio co-founder and CEO Jeff Lawson and asked him about a potential IPO. At the time he obviously couldn’t say much. “Potentially one day? Sure. [But] the IPO is not a goal in and of itself,” he said. But since then, his company, which helps developers build audio, video and text messaging into their apps, has successfully gone public.

Once again, I will sit down with Lawson, who will join us at Disrupt SF next month to discuss the process of going public and what it means for Twilio. It was also the first tech company to go public this year, ending a long drought of tech IPOs.

Twilio priced its IPO at $15 and the stock popped 60 percent on the first day. Today, it is tradingaround $42.

That alone should give us plenty to talk about, but even as the company went public, it didn’t stop releasing new products, including a newadd-on marketplacefor third-party tools.

Before foundingTwilio, Lawson was at Amazon, where he was one of the first product managers on the AWS team. He was also the founding CTO of StubHub; founder and CTO of NineStar; and the founder, CTO and CEO of storage startup Versity.
