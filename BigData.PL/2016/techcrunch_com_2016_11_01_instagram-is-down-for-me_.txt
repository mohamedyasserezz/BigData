Instagram goes down [update: crisis averted]

Instagram’s app and website were struck by a short service outage today. At around 11:06am, users in the US, Europe, India and elsewhere began a downpour of “Is Instagram down?”. Instagramconfirmedthe downtime with the statement on Twitter:

[Update: However, Instagram soon deleted that tweet as it managed to get its app and site back online quickly at around 10:35am PT]

The outage came at an inopportune time as just this morning Instagramunveiled its new shoppable photo tagsthat let people learn more about products they could buy without leaving the app. Though the announcement of the product test didn’t cause the outage, it could shake the faith of marketers that the app is a reliable place to invest their efforts. But since the outage was so brief, the only ones really shook by it were the most loyal and intense users.
