Aircall raised $8 million for its cloud phone system for teams

In case you missed it,Aircallannouncedlast week that it had raised another $8 million dollars in funding for its call center software-as-a-service. Balderton Capital is leading this Series A round, with New York-based VC firm FJLabs and existing investors also investing.

I’m a bit late to the news because last week wasTechCrunch Disrupt SF. It’s worth mentioning that because Aircallalsoparticipated in theStartup Battlefieldat Disrupt SF a year ago. But Aircall has grown quite a lot since then.

The company started in 2014 and was a simple software-as-a-service for support teams. You could create virtual phone numbers in many different countries and manage calls with different people answering — a sort of modern call center for small support teams. The company raised$800,000from eFounders and business angels at the time.

Aircall has then drastically improved call quality, added features to make it easier for bigger teams, added integrations with popular services, such as Salesforce or Zendesk and launchedmobile apps. The company also raised$2.75 millionfrom Balderton Capital, FundersClub and business angels in January 2016.

There are now many different features when it comes to setting up your call center. You can decide opening hours, add a custom waiting music, distribute calls, record calls, queue customers, transfer calls and more. And with today’s new funding round coming just a few months after the previous one, it confirms what I’ve heard about the company’s incredible growth rate.

Following this round, the French company plans to expand in the U.S. with a new office in New York. Co-founder and CEO Olivier Pailhes plans to move there. The team of 30 will double over the next twelve months. Aircall now has 2,000 customers.
