The TC Meetup + Pitch-off is heading to Seoul, SK on October 27

Get ready for theTC Meetup + Pitch-offin Seoul, because we’ll be there soon.

On October 27, the TC team will descend on South Korea to hold one of our world-famous pitch-offs, in which 10 companies will show off their wares onstage. After all the startups have completed their 60-second, rapid-fire pitches, a panel of expert local VC judges will decide who wins.

First place will get a table in Startup Alley at the next TechCrunch Disrupt conference. Second place will get two tickets to the conference and the Audience Choice winner will get one ticket to the big show.

Applications to the pitch-off close on October 11, so make sure toapply here now.

And if you just want to see what all the fuss is about, we encourage you to come check out the program. Alongside the pitch-off we’ll also be hosting some folks from the local tech scene for fireside chats. And, of course, there will be plenty of time before and after the stage show for networking.

You can purchase tickets here.

We can’t wait to see you!
