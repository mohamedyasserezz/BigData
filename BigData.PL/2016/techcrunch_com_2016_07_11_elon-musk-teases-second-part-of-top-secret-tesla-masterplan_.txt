What could the billionaire be referring to? Well, upon making the tweet, one of his 4.39 million Twitter followers responded by saying, “I already put in my 2 cents on Tesla 2.0,” sharing aLinkedIn article about a Tesla/SolarCity merger. Musk responded with, “Something like that.”

A few hours earlier, heweighed in on another user’s post about bringing Tesla and SolarCity together. Remember, it has only been three weeks since Musk’sTesla made a $2.8 billion offer to acquire his SolarCitysolar panel installation company.

Back in August 2006, Musk rolled out withpart 1 of his Top Secret Tesla Masterplan, vowing to build a sports car, “use that money to build an affordable car,” “usethatmoney to build an even more affordable car,” and “while doing above, also provide zero emission electric power generation options.”

Nearly ten years later and Tesla has accomplished Step 1 and is still preparing to roll out its sub-$30,000 (after tax credit) Model 3 sedan by late next year. The automaker is also working diligently to open the doors of asprawling battery factory in Reno, Nevada, using the batteries to help power its electric vehicles and also making them available to homeowners as a power source.
