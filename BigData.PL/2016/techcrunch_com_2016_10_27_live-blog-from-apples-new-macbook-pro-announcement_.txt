Live from Apple’s New MacBook Pro Announcement

We’re live at Apple’s Cupertino headquarters, where the company is prepping to announce something new.

What might thatsomethingbe? This is where we might normally say we’re not too sure… but there were some pretty big leaks this time around. Everyone’s pretty certain it’s a new MacBook Pro with an OLED touch display built into the keyboard.

But will there be more? Does Apple have anything else up its sleeve? Perhaps! Tune into our liveblog below to find out everything the very second we do.

The event is scheduled to start at 10 a.m. Pacific.
