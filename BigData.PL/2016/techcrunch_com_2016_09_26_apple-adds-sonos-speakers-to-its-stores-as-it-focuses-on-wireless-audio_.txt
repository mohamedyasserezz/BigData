Apple adds Sonos speakers to its stores as it focuses on wireless audio

Did you hear?Wireless audio is the future— at least to Apple. And to that end, Sonos, perhaps the best wireless speakers available, are now available in the Apple Store alongside speakers from B&O, Logitech, and Apple’s Beats.

Applealready sells several wireless speakersbut the Sonos speakers would be the first multi-room system available. The Sonos PLAY:1 and PLAY:5 are available online today and in stores starting October 5th.

It’s unclear where this leaves Beats, Apple’s own audio company. Sonos’s wireless connectivity is proprietary and does not work with other speakers. The microprocessor Apple built to power the wireless AirPods seem to state that Apple is all-in with wireless audio, but it does not have a wireless speaker system of its own.

Apple could be a little gun-shy on producing another speaker product. The last one sounded fantastic, but a retail flop. It’s likely, though, if Apple were to integrate its W1 wireless audio processor into a product, it would do so in a Beats product — or buy Sonos and integrate it there, too.
