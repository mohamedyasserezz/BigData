He’s witty. He’s thought-provoking. He’s atweeting machine. Some also believe thebig betspioneered by his venture firm began a fast rise in startup valuations, as hedge funds, mutual funds and others took notice.

We are thrilled to announce that Marc Andreessen is coming toDisrupt SF, being held September 12-14 at beautiful Pier 48 in San Francisco.

Come listen as we ask about the fast-evolving landscape in which Andreessen and his VC peers are now operating — one where the IPO window remains largely closed, secondary stock sales have becomede rigueurand new money frombig firmsandforeign investorsalike makes it hard to know exactly what’s happening.

We’ll also be talking with Andreessen about the M&A market (which he expects will continue toheat up), whether he ever wavers in his optimism about the tech industry and what hereallythinks ofDonald Trump.

And that’s just for starters. It’ll undoubtedly be a highlight of our show this year. You won’t want to miss it.
