5 supercar secrets starring the 2017 McLaren 570GT

Supercars are called super for a reason: these are not everyday sedans. They’re more powerful, more strikingly designed, and more expensive than the cars we usually drive to work. But there are some things you probably don’t know about supercars. I’ll use the 2017 McLaren 570GT to illustrate.

The takeaway here is that supercars, even “the most practical model ever launched by McLaren Automotive,” are exceptional. They are built for people who view driving as a pleasure, not a task to be endured. These are for owners who are willing to pay $215,000 in the case of the 570GT to hear the engine wind through the twisties all the way to the cabin in the mountains. These drivers are not bringing huge coolers or entire wardrobes along. So while supercars are not very good for mundane chores like getting groceries, picking up one kid after school in the 570GT would be certifiably awesome — as long as their backpack isn’t too big.
