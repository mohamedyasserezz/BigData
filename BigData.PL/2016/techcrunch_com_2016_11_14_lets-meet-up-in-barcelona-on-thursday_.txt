Let’s meet up in Barcelona on Thursday

I’m in Barcelona for a few days and I’d love to meet some of the local startups so I’d like to run a mini-meetup somewhere in the city. That said, I have no idea where to hold it so I need your suggestions.

I’m thinking we hold something small at a pub in the city center on Thursday night. If it works out we can possibly have a mini-pitchoff and I’ll have some free tickets to Disrupt London in December. It should be an interesting time.

PleaseRSVP hereso I know how many people to expect.You can email me at john@beta.techcrunch.com if you’d like to help organize and I hope to see you this week.
