Michelle Obama is now on Snapchat

Michelle Obama has joined Snapchat. The First Lady announced yesterday that she is joining the platform so users can see a behind-the-scenes look at her life in the White House. You can add her using the QR code above, or by manually adding “MichelleObama”.

In addition to her daily life, she’ll be Snapchatting her upcomingLet Girls Learntrip to Liberia, Morocco and Spain so “young people everywhere” can follow her trip. In aMedium postannouncing her new account, the First Lady’s office acknowledged that more than half of 13- to 34-years-old smartphone users are on Snapchat, which definitely seems like it would make it a great medium for Obama to communicate her message to the younger generation.

Besides her upcoming trip, the account will showcase ways to stay healthy and active (including tours of the White House Kitchen Garden) and updates on various White House initiatives likeJoining ForcesandReach Higher.

So far, the First Lady showed abackstage viewof her singing Carpool Karaoke with comedian James Corden and a Cosmopolitan shoot with girls from her Let Girls Learn initiative.

Since the account is her personal name (instead of something like FirstLady), expect Obama to keep the account after she leaves the White House. While the President isn’t yet on Snapchat, there is anofficial White House account, which will probably be passed down to whoever wins in November.

Oh, and in case you were wondering, the First Lady is “verified” on Snapchat — she has the 💁🏾 emoji next to her name!
