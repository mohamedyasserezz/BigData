If there’s one thing I consistently love and can be trusted to both enjoy free or even pay money for, it’s fireplace videos. Sometimes called yule log videos, too, these are those things you see on Netflix, in the Apple TV App Store and on YouTube that just show a fireplace for a long period of time, often looping a clip and sometimes including music or sound effects. They’re arguably the best televisual content currently available, and Marvel wants in on that red-hot market.

The Disney-owned superhero brand behind favorites including The Avengers, Iron Man and Mrs. Marvel released five separate fireplace videos in 4K resolution on its YouTube channel, each around an hour in length. The Coca-Cola-sponsored clips also include an “up close” variant in 1080p HD, since the 4K originals are way zoomed out to give you a sense of the surrounding environment, each of which ‘belongs’ to a specific Marvel superhero or super team.

There are videos for Guardians of the Galaxy, Iron Man, Thor, Ms. Marvel and Captain America, and each contains some set dressing unique to the character, as well as background audio that will make you feel like you’re right there next to these heroes enjoying their hearth.

Some of the videos also appear to contain brief Easter Eggs, but not that are particularly revelatory about plot points or aching like that, unfortunately. There’s a dancing baby Groot in the Guardians one that is shamelessly adorable, though, if you’re looking for that sweet, sweet sap.

All of the fireplace videos are included in the YouTube playlist embedded above, so go ahead dim the lights, mull some wine and enjoy the vibes.
