The NFL is the first sports league on Snapchat Discover

The NFL and Snapchat heart each other, and will continue to heart each other for multiple years to come: The twoannouncedan extension to their “strategic partnership” today, which includes Snapchat’s first official sports league Discover channel, an NFL-programmed collection of piping hot football fan service content.

The NFL is also doubling down on its existing commitment to create Live Stories, promising one produced for every single NFL official season game, including the Super bowl, and for special events like the NFL Draft. Live Stories from the NFL blend behind-the-scenes content from insiders, as well as fan-created Snaps added via location-based contributions.

Also in store for NFL fans are custom-created Snapchat Geofilters for each of the NFL’s 32 teams. These will appear for fans whenever they’re in proximity of NFL stadiums, as well as practice facilities and “select venues” — maybe your local sports pub, provided they’re committed enough to the home team?

Basically, the NFL wants fans who also have Snapchat to never have to experience an NFL-less day on the social network, and they’re covering their bases (covering the field with zone defense? Sports metaphors are very challenging for me) with custom features in every conceivable part of the service.

Snapchat’s redesigned Discover section was intended to bring more brands on board, and this NFL partnership gives them a marquee addition in a new area. It also provides another way for Snapchat to skew older and more mainstream, while the NFL might be able to reach a new generation of audience via the service. For Snapchat, at least, this is likely a revenue touchdown (nailed that “red zone” sports metaphor — and there’s a bonus one for you, too).
