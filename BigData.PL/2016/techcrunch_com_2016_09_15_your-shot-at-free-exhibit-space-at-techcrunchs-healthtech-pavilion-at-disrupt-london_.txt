Here’s your shot at free exhibit space at TechCrunch’s Healthtech Pavilion at Disrupt London

While Europe’s technology ecosystem is growing, there’s sometimes a view that it lags behind the U.S. for healthtech or Health 2.0, or whatever you want to call it. But that’s basically bullshit. While Europe has been a slow starter, it’s catching up very fast. There are many new EU-based healthtech companies, and a brief analysis of CrunchBase shows that while the U.K. has the most, it’s closely followed by Germany, France, the Netherlands and Spain.

At TechCrunch’s upcomingDisrupt London, 5-6 December, we will host a startup pavilion for healthtech companies. Because there are lots of very early-stage startups in healthtech and biotech, we are offering five companies in each category the chance to exhibit free of charge.

Here’s what exhibitors in the Disrupt London special pavilion for healthtech can expect:
