Sony may unveil two new versions of the PS4 next month

Sony will reportedly unveil two new versions of the PlayStation 4 at its upcoming New York press event on September 7.

We already knowthat the company is set to launch a more powerful version of the console — called ‘Neo’ — but nowthe Wall Street Journal is reportingthat it will also refresh its standard model. There are no precise details right now, but the Journal — citing sources — said that the two different versions of the PS4 are designed to broaden the appeal and “attract hardcore fans and more casual users to its videogame platform.”

Sony has sold more than 40 million PS4 consoles, and its games are continuing to sell well, too. While it has scaled back its loss-making mobile business and suffered the financial impact of the Kumamoto earthquake on its manufacturing operations, the PlayStation business is booming. The gaming division accounted for 75 percent of Sony’s profits inits most recent Q1 2016 quarter of businesssuch is its importance to the Japanese tech giant.

Additional games consoles aren’t the only notable new gaming development planned for Sony.The company said earlier this yearthat it will begin producing games for iOS and Android for the first time,following rival Nintendo’s lead, but it clarified that these titles would be focused on users based in Asia.

That’s bound to disappoint millions of ardent fans elsewhere in the world — but they can at least look forward to new versions of the PS4. And, if they are partial to nostalgia,Nintendo is rebooting its classic NES consolewith a miniature version just in time for Christmas.

Then there’s the Xbox camp, whichjust released the (very attractive) Xbox One S model, andwill introduce its next games console— “Project Scorpio” — in 2017.

Lots to look forward to!
