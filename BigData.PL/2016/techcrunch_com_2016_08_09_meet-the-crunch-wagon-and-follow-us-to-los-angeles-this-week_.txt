Meet the Crunch Wagon and follow us to Los Angeles this week

The TechCrunch video team is headed to LA. We’ve packed our cameras, grabbed our tripods and are heading to the City of Angels to talk to exciting startups about VR, entertainment and transportation.

Oh, and we’re picking up our brand new van along the way.

The TC video team will be taking the reins of the Crunch Wagon to navigate the magnificent creature over the Grapevine, along the California coast all the way to her new home in San Francisco. The van is chock full of bells and whistles, like a monster editing setup, new monitors, fast Wi-Fi and a LOT of power. We’re really excited to drive it all over LA, edit and upload videos in the middle of the desert and meet with all of you along the way. Look out for our Snapcode around town, it will be on the side of the van. You can follow along on the journey by adding us on Snapchat or checking out #CrunchWagon on Twitter.

We’re also having aMini-Meetup on Wednesday, August 10, from 6-8 p.m.at WeWork’s new Culver City location. Come hang out with some of the TechCrunch writers and the video team for a good time over drinks and apps to discuss tech, news, startups and your thoughts on the LA tech scene.

We are also really stoked to peel back the curtain and give everyone a behind the scenes look at how TC video works, including the cameras and gear we use, as well as the crazy adventures along the way. Look out for my man TitoCrunchReportin’on the road and the rest of the team vlogging, Snapchatting and Instagramming all throughout the week.
