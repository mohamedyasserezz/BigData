Novelist Eliot Peper talks about fiction as a foreign country

This week on theTechnotopia podcastI talked toEliot Peper, the author of the cyberpunk novel Cumulus.

Peper talked about the value of science fiction as travel for the mind. He has been an entrepreneur and VC and finds that those industries are often more about checking off boxes in a spreadsheet rather than true exploration. By writing – and reading – speculative fiction Peper thinks we get some of the best assessments of our present.
