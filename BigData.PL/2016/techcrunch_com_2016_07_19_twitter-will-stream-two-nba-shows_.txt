Twitter will exclusively stream two original NBA shows

Two weeks ago,Twitter was reportedly in talks with the NBAto acquire digital rights to stream hoops action.

Well, those discussions materialized quicker than a LeBron James-led fast break.Recode is reportingthat Twitter will exclusively stream two live and original NBA programs weekly, beginning next season. The social media network will also double the amount of NBA game highlights it tweets out to the masses and posts on Vine. We emailed to Twitter to learn more about the shows, but the company kept mum about the programming content.

The bad news is Twitter is stopping short of streaming actual games the way it will be doing with 10 NFLThursday Night Footballgames this fall. Just imagine being able to tweet in real-time, while watching Stephen Curry break a defender’s ankles or pull up from way beyond the three-point line.

The report from a couple of weeks back also suggested that Twitter is speaking with Major League Soccer and cable television giant Turner about acquiring digital streaming rights. So, it remains to be seen what will come of those negotiations as well. Stay tuned.
