Selency raises $3.3 million for its online marketplace for second-hand furniture

French startupSelency(formerly known as Brocante Lab) has raised a $3.3 million Series A round (€3 million) led by Accel with Kima Ventures participating.

Many of you should be familiar with online furniture retailers likeMade.com. But what about second-hand furniture? Right now, you still have to go to an antique shop, or maybe look for classified ads on the web. Or maybe you’ll have to block your Sunday to go to a flea market. It’s nowhere near as convenient as ordering something on an e-commerce website.

Selency plans to solve that by working with both customers and professional dealers in the second-hand furniture industry. All of them can list their items on Selency. On the other end of the equation, browsing Selency is a much more visual and convenient experience — if you want a desk, you can just browse the desk category and look at photos.

In particular, it could make second-hand furniture more accessible to customers who just don’t want to spend time looking for the perfect chair.

Over a thousand professional sellers use the platform to list their items. Selency lets you pick up the piece of furniture yourself if you happen to be nearby. The seller can also ship it, or Selency can take care of the delivery.

Accel’s Luciana Lixandru and Showroomprivé’s Thierry Petit are joining the board. The company plans to use today’s funding round for marketing purposes and to hire more people and improve the product.
