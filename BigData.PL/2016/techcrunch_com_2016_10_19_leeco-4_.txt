LeEco is launching a US video service with some high profile partners

After much pomp and circumstance around ecosystems and philosophy, LeEco finally debuted something new at today’s massive press conference in San Francisco.

Perhaps predictably, one of the first US-based offerings from the company often referred to as “the Netflix of China” will be a content platform. And, as with just about everything else at today’s event, LeEco’s coming out swinging.

The list of partners for LeEco Live includes MGM, Lionsgate, Vice, Showtime, Sling and Magnolia Pictures, along with publication partners like Cosmopolitan and Esquire, to name but a few (you can see the full list of partners above).

The press conference is still really light on the details of precisely what form the service will take, but it looks to be integrated with LeEco’s recent purchase of US-based budget television maker Vizio, a few months back.

The company has also been working on its own content. Last month it purchasedDichotomy Creative Group, a new English language production company run by former Paramount pictures president, Adam Goodman.

And then, of course, there’s the upcoming Matt Damon filmThe Great Wall, which the company produced. The first trailer for that film dropped in July and also got some stage time at today’s event.
