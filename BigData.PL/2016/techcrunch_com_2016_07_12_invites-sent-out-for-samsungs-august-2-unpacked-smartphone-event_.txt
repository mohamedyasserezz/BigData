Invites sent out for Samsung’s August 2 Unpacked smartphone event

Samsung just mailed out invitations for its Samsung Unpacked 2016 event, where it’s expected to unveil its latest Note smartphone. The event is taking place August 2 at 11AM EST, and will be live-streamed onsamsung.com.

The device is likely going to be called the Note 7, something seemingly confirmed by the language on the invite itself. This is being done for unity’s sake for the product line, despite the fact that there was never a Note 6.

The invite also seems to declare that the smartphone stylus accompanying the Note 7 is here for another year, at least. We already have a pretty good idea what the exterior of the device is going to look like thanks to images leaked online by prominent Samsung leaker Evan Blass. Main takeaways from the images are the edge-to-edge curved screen and what appears to be an iris scanner.

The internals are a bit more up for debate, particularly whether the Note 7 will adopt a USB Type-C port and the updated Snapdragon 821 chipset.

The invite is scant on details, but we’ll be there next month keeping you updated on what is announced regarding Samsung’s latest flagship phablet.
