Only a few days left to save $1,000 on Disrupt SF tickets

Disrupt SF 2016 is right around the corner, and time is running out to get tickets to the hottest startup show in the Bay Area for the lowest possible price.

You have just four days left to snag early-bird tickets to Disrupt for $1,995 apiece, a full $1,000 less than what it will cost you when early-bird ticket sales end on Friday. Head overto our ticketing pageand get your deeply discounted tickets to Disrupt today. Go ahead — your wallet will thank you.

That ticket is your all-access pass to everything that makes Disrupt great. You’ll get to connect with the hundreds of early-stage startups that are on display in Startup Alley and Hardware Alley, and check out dozens of companies in the Startup Battlefield competition, vying for $50,000, the coveted Disrupt Cup and, perhaps more importantly, the attention of the tech community at large.

You’ll also get to learn from some of the best and brightest innovators, investors and entrepreneurs in the series of interviews and fireside chats that we have lined up throughout the course of the three-day event. People like SV Angel Managing Partner Brian Pokorny, Twitch CEO Emmett Shear and LinkedIn co-founder and executive chair Reid Hoffman, to name but a few.

Plus, you’ll get to attend all the parties and after-parties to keep the networking and the good times going long after the show floor closes for the day.

The best, most wallet-friendly way to get into Disrupt is by getting your Disrupt tickets at our early-bird price points, so save yourselves the headache and the $1,000 and get your tickets today.
