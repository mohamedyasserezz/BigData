If you’re still playingPokemon Go, then you’ve likely invested enough time and energy to care about this DIY Pokemon Go helmet.

Before we go any further, this video is obviously for fun and isn’t available for sale — worth mentioning since I’m sure more than a few peopleactuallygot excited about this.

And for what it’s worth, Giertz isn’t the only one still riding that Pokemon Go wave. Niantic, makers of the game, have seen more than $250 million in revenue since the game launched earlier this summer.
