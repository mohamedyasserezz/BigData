T-Mobile’s top brass warns some iPhone owners against iOS 10 upgrades

Maybe don’t go upgrading to iOS 10 just yet, T-Mobile customers. The magenta-drenched uncarrier hastaken to social mediato warn owners of the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, and iPhone SE against rushing into Apple’s latest major mobile operating system update after widespread reports of lost network connections.

Both outspoken CEO John Legere and CTO Neville Ray have issued warnings on Twitter, noting that Apple is currently working to address the issue and expects to offer a fix within the next 24 to 48 hours.

In the meantime, however, there’s a fairly inelegant workaround for the issue, for those who have already gone ahead and upgraded their OS. Ray suggests that users manually restart their handset every time a connection is lost.

The carrier will put out word as soon as things are back up and running — assuming, of course, that users can get online to see it. Meantime, you can live vicariously through ouriOS 10 reviewthat went up earlier this week.
