Hardware Battlefield application deadline extended

We get it. You’re busy building a robot that can eat human food. That’s why we’ve extended the deadline for applications for TechCrunch’s Hardware Battlefield for a few more days.Submit your applicationby Monday November 14 at 9pm PT to compete for free demo space at the Consumer Electronics Show, $50,000 and the Metal Man trophy.

For those of you following along at home, Hardware Battlefield is part of TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield series, but with a few small differences. Of course, there is the requirement that participating companies must have a hardware component to their product. In today’s world, that means everything from IoT devices to 3D printing, wearables to robots.

Hardware Battlefield takes places at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada. Battlefield contestants still have 6 minutes to pitch to our judging panel, followed by 6 minutes of live Q/A. Judges include hardware investors like Rob Coneybeer, Highway1 and HAX, top designers like Yves Behar and product experts like Susan Paley.

This year we’re also going bigger. TechCrunch’s booth is located right at the Mezzanine of the Sands Expo, which means that anyone and everyone walking to check out exhibits will be stopping by TechCrunch.

Applying and participating in the Hardware Battlefield is entirely free and we welcome entries from across the globe. TechCrunch recently launched aBattlefield Scholarship Fundto assist startups that have raised less than $1 million offset any additional costs associated with attending the event.

Startups must have a functional prototype to demo to the selection committee. TechCrunch will give preference to companies debuting a product to the public and press via the competition.
