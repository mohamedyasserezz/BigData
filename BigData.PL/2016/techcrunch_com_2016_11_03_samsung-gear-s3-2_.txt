Samsung’s big Gear S3 smartwatch arrives November 18

Been a while since we’ve heard much about theGear S3. Since it was first shown off back in August at IFA, Apple has announced and released their own new offering and, of course, Samsung’s been slightly preoccupied with other things.

But fear not, the super-sized smartwatch will be arriving in time for the holidays. Pre-orders start November 6 and the device will be hitting retailers, including Best Buy, Amazon, Macy’s and Samsung’s own site on the 18th.

As previously noted, the Gear S3 comes in two varieties, — the Frontier and Classic — starting at $350. Both are, for what it’s worth, quite large, with 42mm cases, coupled with all those smartwatch internals, measuring 0.51 inches thick. They’re both IP68 water and dust resistant, have 1.3-inch always on displays, Samsung Pay compatibility, 4GB of storage and 380mAh batteries, promising up to three days on a charge.

Aside from aesthetic case design differences, the outdoor-themed Frontier features LTE connectivity, and will be made available through AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon stores. Pricing on the 4G version is still forthcoming and will be announced by the carriers themselves.

And since I’m sure you all have hilarious jokes about whether or not it’ll catch fire that you can’t wait to share, go ahead and leave them in the comments below.
