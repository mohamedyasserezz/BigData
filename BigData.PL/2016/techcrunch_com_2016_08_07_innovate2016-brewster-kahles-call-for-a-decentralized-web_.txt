Brewster Kahle, the Internet’s most famous librarianand aninducteeof the Internet Hall of Fame, believes that the time has come to build a better Web.

The problem, he says, is that the Internet is no longer either private or secure. So his argument, summarized in awhite paper entitled “Locking the Web Open: A Call for a Decentralized Web”, says that we now need to rebuilt the Web to ensure that it guarantees both privacy and security for its users.

He launched his new mission in June with ahigh profileSan Francisco event featuring other Internet hall-of-famers like Tim Berners-Lee and Vint Cerf. But Kahle – who pioneered the Internet Archive’sWayback Machinewhich has stored almost 500 billion web pages for the public record – doesn’t want to go back to the Internet’s pre commercial origins.

The technology now exists, he says, to create websiteswhich can be hosted “everywhere and nowhere”.Finally, he says, we have the technology to build both a genuinely public and commercial Internet which protects rather than exploits its users. And his call is for start-up entrepreneurs to join his mission.
