Janica Alvarez to talk innovation in women’s medtech at Disrupt SF

Janica Alvarez, CEO and co-founder of Naya Health, is slated to speak at Disrupt SF this September.

Janica’smission for Naya Healthis to create better experiences for moms through a range of early-infant nutritional products and services. Based in Redwood City, CA,Naya Healthhas raised $3.9 million in seed funding to reinvent the breast pump and bottle.

Prior to co-founding Naya Health with her husband, Janica spent more than 10 years leading teams in healthcare and clinical research, including at biotech giants Genentech and Gilead Sciences. She was responsible for the launch and management of the review and approval by the FDA of a dozen revenue-generating oncology and HIV therapies in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.

Now, the goal is to make a breast pump that is more comfortable and efficient for moms than the clunky, mass-marketed devices currently available to women who are breastfeeding.

In September, Alvarez will join us at TechCrunch Disrupt SF to discuss her vision for the future of smarter nutritional products like Naya’s pump, and what’s next for innovation in the women’s medtech space.

Early-bird tickets are available now.We hope you can make it out to the event this September.
