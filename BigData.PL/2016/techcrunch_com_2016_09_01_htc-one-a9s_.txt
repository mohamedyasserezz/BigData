HTC’s latest features middling specs in a slightly ruggedized exterior

“Inspired by nature, created for life” is HTC’s customarily grandiose tagline for the admittedly awkwardly named One A9s. All that hyperbole means, essentially, that this is a nice looking handset that can withstand a drop or two. The specs on the other hand are fairly meh.

HTC’s new five-inch handset looks a fair deal like its predecessor, which is to say, it looks a fair deal like Apple’s last couple of phones. No word on exact military specs on the thing, but the company notes in its press material that the device’s dual-finish metal body was subjected to “hundreds of drop and scratch tests in addition to hundreds of hours of extreme weather testing for long-lasting reliability.”

The specs aren’t much to talk about – you really get the sense a company doesn’t have a lot to hang its hat on when it leads with the fingerprint reader. The five-inch display is an underwhelming 720p, bolstered be an octa-core processor from MediaTek and either 2 or 3GB of RAM.

Storage comes in either 16 or 32GB configurations, which can be augmented via the microSD slot, up to 2TB (assuming you can find a card that large). The battery isn’t much to speak of at 2,300mAh, though the phone features a power saving mode and supports fast-charging.

The rear-facing 13-megapixel camera features a BSI sensor for low light and the device can shoot in RAW. The front-facing 5MP shooter, meanwhile, is augmented by a slew of selfie-focused features like voice shooting and “live makeup.” Price has yet to be announced, but it’s expected to be more affordable than its predecessor.
