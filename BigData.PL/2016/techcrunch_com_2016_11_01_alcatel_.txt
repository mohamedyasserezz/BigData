Alcatel’s new Windows phone is a T-Mobile exclusive

Alcatel’s new Windows phone is coming exclusively to T-Mobile on November 10 here in the States, priced at $470. And the company’s cramming the package full of free stuff, including a pair of VR goggles built specifically for the device, a 45-day free trial of Hulu Plus, a 30-day trial of Microsoft’s Groove music service and a copy of Halo: Spartan Assault, all aimed to get you aboard the admittedly slow moving Windows 10 Mobile train.

As far as, you know, actual specs go, the TCL Mobile-licensed handset brand (the company that’s also making BlackBerry’s new devices) is referring to the 5.5-inchAlcatel Idol 4Sas a flagship. The components are pretty solid on a number of accounts, but not exactly earth shattering. The screen clocks in at 1920 x 1080, powered by a Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage (which can be augmented by the microSD slot).

The camera rear-facing camera is 21-megapixels and the battery is a solid 3000mAh, coupled with USB-C quick charging. There are also some fine-tuned hi-fi speakers up front for an improved sound. Not too bad for the price – assuming you’re game for the whole Windows smartphone experience, of course. And hey, free VR headset.
