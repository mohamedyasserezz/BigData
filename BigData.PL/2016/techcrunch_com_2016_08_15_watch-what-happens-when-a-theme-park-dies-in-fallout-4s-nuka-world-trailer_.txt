Fallout 4’s latest expansion, Nuka-World, is coming ton August 30, and puts you smack dab in the middle of a decrepit, low-rent Disney World snatched right from your nightmares. It does look like a blast, with animatronic wonders and a variety of different themed park sections to explore. New quests are included in the DLC, as well as new item and building options so you can make your own funland horror show.

For me, Fallout games are consistently at the top of my play list, and this expansion will probably get me back in the Fallout 4 world for an extended play session at least. The Nuka-World expansion is the sixth add-on from Bethesda for Fallout 4, and retails for $19.99.
