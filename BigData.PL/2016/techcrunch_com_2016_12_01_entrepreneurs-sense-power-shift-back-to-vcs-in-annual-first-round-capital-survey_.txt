Entrepreneurs sense power shift back to VCs in annual First Round Capital survey

First Round Capitaljust published its second-ever State of Startups report, and it’s chock full of interesting sentiments from a survey of more than 700 founders — some of whom have ties to the early-stage venture firm and some who operate outside it.

Taken altogether, it suggests that founders remain highly optimistic about their chances of success, but they also sense that some of their leverage has slipped away when it comes to dealing with investors and raising subsequent rounds of follow-on funding.

Here’s a linkto the complete survey.

Among what we think are its most interesting findings:

Also interesting to us: founders’ plans, or lack of them, to go public. While 23 percent told First Round that they expected it would take another three to five years to go public, a stunning 31 percent said they didn’t intend to IPO, suggesting (we guess?) that they expect to be acquired.
