ASUS shows off a portable 15-inch display for laptop owners

The ZenScreen is a strange, but intriguing duck. It’s not a tablet or a convertible notebook, it’s a 15.6-inch portable screen. That mean it’s not a standalone device so much as it is an extra display designed to offer laptop users additional real estate on the go, connect to a primary device via USB-A or C.

ASUS is really pushing the portability factor here, and with a thickness of 8mm and a weight of 1.8 pounds, it does seem to offer quite a bit on that front. It’s probably not light enough to carry on your person at all times in addition to a standard laptop, but it’s easy to so see your average power user packing it up for a long business trip.

The screen will launch with a kickstand case, or barring that, the company encourages you to just stick a pen or pencil in the little notch on the bottom bezel and it’ll stand up straight. You can also opt to stand it up in portrait mode, if that’s your bag. The ZenScreen is set to run €269 (just a hair under $300) in Europe. No official release date has been announced.
