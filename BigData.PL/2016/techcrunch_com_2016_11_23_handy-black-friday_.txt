Handy’s Black Friday promo rewards contractors over customers

Handy, the on-demand service for cleaners, handymen, and more, has today announced the Give > Get promotion for Black Friday.

This Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, customers pay the same amount as they’d usually pay, but the company will add a 50 percent bonus to the Handy Professional’s paycheck.

The booking itself doesn’t need to be for Black Friday, but the booking has to bemadeon Black Friday for the promotion to apply.

Handy started out as an on-demand cleaning service and has since expanded to offer storage, handyman work, and painting. The company currently serves 28 markets and has “thousands” of Handy Professionals on the platform.

This new crop of large-scale on-demand startups, which rely on both end-users and contracted 1099 workers to provide service, begs an interesting question during the holiday season. During a day like Black Friday, traditionally geared toward luring customers with steep discounts, Handy is instead shifting focus to its contracted workers by giving them bonus earnings.

Considering Handy’s business isn’t suited to being used on a holiday weekend, this Black Friday promotion is an interesting way to get end-users on the platform on a day they normally wouldn’t be, while incentivizing the legs (contractors) of the platform.
