Uber will open a new facility in Detroit

Uber VP Sherif Marakby told attendees at the SAE Convergence conference in Novi, Michigan today that it will open a new facility in the metro Detroit area in the “coming months,” in order to better partner with car companies and tier-1 suppliers, according toThe Detroit News.

Marakby is actually an ex-Ford employee, having worked for the company for 25 years prior to joining Uber, and worked primarily out of Ford’s Dearborn HQ, so he knows the area well. Marakby has been stationed out of Uber’s Pittsburgh research facility (where itsself-driving test is taking place) since joining Uber as VP of Global Vehicle Programs earlier this year.

Details abut what the Uber Detroit facility will do, how many employees it’ll host or the specific location of the office aren’t available because Uber is still finalizing the lease details for the facility. Marakby also stressed that “Uber is not in the business of making cars,” according to the Detroit News, emphasizing that its focus with the new facility is to be closer to potential and existing partners.
