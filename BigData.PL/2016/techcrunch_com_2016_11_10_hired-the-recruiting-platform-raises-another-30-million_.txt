Hired, the recruiting platform, raises another $30 million

Hired, the platform that lets applicants vie for top tech jobs, has announced a $30 million extension to its Series C funding, bringing the total of that particular round to $70 million.

The funding came primarily from Glenmede Trust and Ontario Pension Board, with participation from existing investors.

On Hired, folks seeking a job can simply answer a few questions and receive back compensation offers from top tech companies. These companies then have the option to pay Hired 15 percent of the employee’s first-year salary.

In November of last year, the companyintroduced a product for freelancersthat works similar to the core product.

Here’s what CEO Mehul Patel had to say about it:

Ultimately we believe that people want to feel a sense of purpose in their everyday work, to feel challenged and grow their skills, and to have the sense that their job isn’t just a job, but truly is an opportunity. My hope is that armed with these additional financial resources, we can be the partner people turn to as they move from one opportunity to the next, to fulfill our own mission of helping everyone get a job they love.

This latest extension brings Hired’s total funding to $102 million.
