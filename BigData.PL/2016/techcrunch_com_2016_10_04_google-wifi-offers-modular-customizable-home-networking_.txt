Google Wifi offers modular, customizable home networking

GooglerevealedWifi today — not the underlying tech, of course, but a new piece of hardware that wants to make it even easier to bathe your whole home in wonderful, soothing connectedness. Google Wifi is a new router, which basically is a tiny device that can pair up with others to create a more robust, more far-reaching home network that will ensure more reliable performance across the board.

The new Wifi router also acts as a low-cost alternative to existing OnHub offerings from ASUS and TP-Link, which cost $200 regularly. At $129, the new Google Wifi hardware is similarly priced to offerings like Apple’s Airport Express and, even when three are purchased, the lot is much cheaper than a pack ofthe similar Eero routers. It’s definitely one of the cheapest options with the full gamut of modern wireless networking technology support, including AC1200 speeds, and Bluetooth connectivity for simpler set up and for making the mesh tech work.

Network Assist optimizes your router performance behind the scenes, but a companion app gives you direct control over network conditions.

Also, Wifi gets a cost benefit once you start adding additional units: Google is offering pack pricing of $299 per pack of three, which means if you need to outfit a larger house you’re still going to be paying less than you might for a top of the line individual router from another company. Wifi ships in December.
