It’s official: Android N is now Android Nougat

Aaaand there it is. Android N — the next version of Android, coming later this summer — officially has a name: Android Nougat.

Sorry, Android Nutella-hopefuls. Don’t like the name? Think of it this way: At least more people will know how the heck to spell “Nougat” now.

Android has a history of using alphabetically ordered sweet-treat names for Android — Android 1.5 was Cupcake, 1.6 was Donut, then Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich (still my favorite), Jelly Bean, KitKat, Lollipop and Marshmallow. This time around, Google opened thename-storming session up to the Internet at large.

News of the naming came by way of the official Android twitter feed, where the company also revealed the name-themed statue it builds for each release:
