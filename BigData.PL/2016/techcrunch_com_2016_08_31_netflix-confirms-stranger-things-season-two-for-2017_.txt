The 1984 setting means time has jumped forward a year or so from the events of Stranger Things season one, which is in keeping with some things we were hearing earlier about a time jump.

If you haven’t checked out season one, you should: It’s a terrific 80s throwback with lots of spooky charm and a plot that keeps you gripped to your seat. No spoilers beyond that though – you deserve to see it spoiler free.
