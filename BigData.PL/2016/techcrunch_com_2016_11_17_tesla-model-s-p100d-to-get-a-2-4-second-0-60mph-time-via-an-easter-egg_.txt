Tesla Model S P100D to get a 2.4-second 0-60 mph time via an Easter egg

Tesla Easter eggs are a lot more interesting than most of those found in video games: case in point, itsnext onewill boost the acceleration of theP100D variantof its Model S up to a 2.4-second 0-60 mph time with Ludicrous Mode, with a quarter-mile achievable in as little as 10.6 seconds. The P100D Model X will also get a slight boost, with 0.1 second shaved off both times.

The current P100D with Ludicrous Mode is already the fastest production car in the world, according to Tesla, but the 0.1-second improvement will put it at the very top of the heap for 0-60 acceleration, beating out the $845K Porsche 918 Spyder — which also claims a 2.5-second time for that standard measure of performance.

Tesla’s delivering the speed boost via a software update coming next month. While Tesla has delivered performance improvements via software changes in the past, this is the first time it’s offering up such a tweak as an Easter egg, which means owners will have to figure out how to unlock the hidden feature before they can use it.

Other Tesla Easter eggs include a mode that turns the in-car display into a James Bond-themed console from the Lotus submarine car used inThe Spy Who Loved Me. You unlock this by keying “007” into the car’s service console login.

There’s no word yet on how the new speed improvements will be unlocked when they roll out via an update in December, but it likely won’t take long for intrepid and enthusiastic P100D owners to find out once it’s available.
