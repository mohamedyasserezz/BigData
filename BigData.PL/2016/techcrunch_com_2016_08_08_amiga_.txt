Internet Archive posted 10,000 browser-playable Amiga titles – go, play

Seriously, go. Enjoy yourself. It’s Monday. We’ll still be here when you get back. It’s bound to be a long week. The world is coming apart at the seams. Your boss won’t notice if you play a round or two ofBubble Bobblefrom the comfort of your own browser (Firefox seems to work best on my end).

We can’t vouch for the quality of all of theAmiga titles that were recently posted up on Archive.org, but there sure as heck are a lot of them – 10,000+, by the site’s count, including favorites asWhere in the World is Carmen San Diego, King’s QuestandDouble Dragon, along with what looks to be a fair amount of redundancy. I’m not really sure what the difference is betweenDeluxe Pac Man v1.1andDeluxe Pac Man v1.7a, but I suspect it’s fairly minor, even for completists.

Surely crawling through the pages of pages of vastly fluctuating game quality is part of the fun, right? Enjoy yourselves, gumshoes.
