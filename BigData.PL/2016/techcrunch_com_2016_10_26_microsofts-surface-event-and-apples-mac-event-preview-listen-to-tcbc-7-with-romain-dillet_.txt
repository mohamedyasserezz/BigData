Microsoft’s Surface event and Apple’s Mac event preview: Listen to TCBC 7 with Romain Dillet

This week’s TCBC podcast is all about events: Microsoft’s and Apple’s, both of which happen this week and both of which will be covered by Romain Dillet, who joins as my guest for the episode. We’re fresh from watching and writing about Microsoft’s event earlier today, where it revealed itsSurface Studio PCand a host of software improvements coming to Windows 10 with the Creator’s Update.

Romain provides some perspective on Microsoft’sannouncements around VRand mixed reality, as well as some insight into what the company hopes to achieve with its new Beam game streaming services. We also talk a bit about the historical appeal of the Surface lineup, and how the Surface Studio might change that target audience.

As for Apple’s Mac event, we don’t have to wait long to find out what’s revealed, but we provide a pretty good summary of what to expect from tomorrow’s event. We also talk about AirPods, but keep in mind this is just before our esteemed boss revealed that theywould not in fact be arriving this month as originally planned. We still get to look forward toa new MacBook Pro, however, and that’s a very exciting prospect, given how long it’s gone without an update.
