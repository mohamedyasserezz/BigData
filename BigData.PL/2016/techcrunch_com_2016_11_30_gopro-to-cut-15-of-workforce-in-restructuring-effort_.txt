GoPro to cut 15% of workforce in restructuring effort

GoPro today announced the company will cut 200 jobs, about 15% of its global workforce. The company says this will reduce its 2017 non-GAAP operating expenses to about $650 million and will help the company fulfill CEO Nick Woodman’s stated goal of returning the company to profitability in 2017.

Company president Tony Bates is stepping down from his position at the end of 2016, saying in a released statement, “Today GoPro has a solid leadership team deeply focused on its core business and profitability.”

GoPro’s stock ticked up slightly in pre-market trading on the news.

The embattled camera maker is facing headwinds as it attempts to stay afloat. For one, the market is changing as cell phones are getting more durable and capable of surviving GoPro-type activities. The company needs to convince consumers that they still need a GoPro. The market is also now flooded with activity cameras that are available for a fraction of the price of GoPro camera. For both these reasons, GoPro is trying to shift away from being just a camera company to becoming a media company.
