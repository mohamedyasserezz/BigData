See you in Wroclaw tomorrow and Friday

It’s Wroclaw Meetupin’ time! I’ll see you all tomorrow and Friday in Wroclaw and it’s going to be a hoot! I’ll be hosting two meetings next week and I want you to come to one or both. The first meetup is part ofImpactCEEand will be held on Wednesday, December 7. You canRSVP here. It’s primarily Fintech-related but, again, you’re welcome to come along to chat and see the pitches. We’ll be picking startups to pitch.

The second meetup is onFriday, December 9and it’s part of the IN-FERENCE conference. We’ll be talking medtech, biotech, and anything non-fintech related. You can submit anapplication to pitchhere. Please note that unless you hear from me specifically you won’t be guaranteed a spot to pitch.

I’m looking forward to getting back into Poland and I’m especially excited about Wroclaw. I’ve been doing a lot of writing on Central Europe these days in an effort tospread the word about new startups in the regionand things are getting quite interesting. I’ll see you all next week and hopefully we can drain a Zywiec or two.
