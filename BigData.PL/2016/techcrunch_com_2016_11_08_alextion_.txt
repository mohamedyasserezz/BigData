Alexa, who is winning the presidential election?

My own personal method for following election results mostly revolves around curling up in the fetal position under my bed with a bottle of whiskey and a security blanket. But for those who want to be a little more engaged without having to immerse themselves fully the 24-hour cable news cycle, Alexa’s got a few tricks up her sleeve that are good for the next few hours.

Along with a handful of otherelection tricks, Amazon’s imbued its AI assistant with the ability to offer up real-time election results today. Users can go as broad as simply asking their Echo, Dot or other Alexa-enabled device who is currently winning, or drill down by candidate or geographical locale.

Some examples from Amazon, “Alexa, which states has Trump won?” “Alexa, which states is Trump projected to win?” “Alexa, how many electoral votes does Hillary have?” “Alexa, what percent of the popular vote does Hillary have?” “Alexa, who won Iowa?” “Alexa, who is winning in Florida?” “Alexa, who is projected to win Idaho?” “Alexa, what are the election results in Idaho?” “Alexa, how many votes did Trump get in Idaho?” “Alexa, what are the election results?”

So you can keep up to date all without ever having to leave the house/under the bed or turning on a TV set, which could do wonders for your blood pressure. And then tomorrow you can ask Alexa how to go about getting Canadian citizenship.
