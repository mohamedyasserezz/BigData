4K Hitachi TVs with Roku built-in are coming to a Sam’s Club near you

You could buy a TV and a Roku player, or you could just go crazy and buy a TV with Roku OS built in. A small handful of TV manufacturers have jumped on the Roku TV train already, including Sharp, Hisense and Haier, and now Hitachi’s officially joined their ranks with a trio of 4K sets.

The first one, a 55-incher, is landing early this month at Sam’s Club, so interested parties can pick up an Ultra HD set at the same place they buy bulk toilet paper. That model, the 55R7, runs $599. It’ll be joined shortly by 50- and 65-inch models, priced at $499 and $999, respectively.

All of the above models feature a quad-core processor and access to Roku’s 3,500 streaming channels, with the added convenience of not having to plug an extra thing into the set. Hitachi and Roku first announced the partnership back in June, a deal that was also set to include some standard HD sets as small as 24-inches, which will likely be ridiculously cheap, given the 4K pricing structure.
