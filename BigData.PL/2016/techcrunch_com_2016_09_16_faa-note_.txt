The FAA asks airlines to prohibit powering up or charging the Galaxy Note 7 on flights

A day after the Consumer Product Safety Commission formally issued a recall of Samsung’s occasional explosion-making Galaxy Note 7, the FAA is offeringa more strictly worded warningagainst the troubled phablet.

A week or so ago, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a fairly benign suggestion, “strongly advis[ing] passengers not to turn on or charge these devices on board aircraft and not to stow them in any checked baggage.”

Today’s statement takes things a step further, but doesn’t go so far as issuing a full ban on the device, which has had at least 35 reported instances of battery problems, according to Samsung’s own numbers.

The administration is asking airlines to prohibit passengers from powering on or plugging in their Galaxy Note 7 on a flight. The notice continues,

Passengers must also protect the devices from accidental activation, including disabling any features that may turn on the device, such as alarm clocks, and must not pack them in checked luggage.

The FAA adds that the regulation do not prohibit specific airlines from placing their own additional bans on specific devices/batteries.
