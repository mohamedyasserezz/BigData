Samsung spills the details of its Note 7 exchange program in US

If you’ve got a Galaxy Note 7, you’ve probably already heard about the recall. But the specifics differ for each region, and Samsung just nowreleased the detailsfor what your options are here in the land of the free.

First thing you’ll want to do is go to wherever you bought your device — they’ll be doing the exchange there. Then you get to choose what kind of exchange you’re looking for.

You can get a new Note 7, of course, “as early as next week” — presumably, once the shipments of non-inflammable batteries have arrived and they’ve been swapped in.

But you can also get a plain Galaxy S7 or a S7 Edge — both solid devices — and get refunded the difference between the two. Accessories will be replaced as well, so you won’t be out any cash if you bought a case or screen protector.

In addition to a new device, everyone who does the exchange will get a $25 gift card or bill credit.

If you have questions, check to make sure your phone isn’t on fire and then dial 1-800-SAMSUNG and they should be able to help you out.
