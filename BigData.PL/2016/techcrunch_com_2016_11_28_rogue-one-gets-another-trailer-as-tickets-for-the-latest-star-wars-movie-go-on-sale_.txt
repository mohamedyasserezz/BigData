Rogue One: A Star Wars Storytickets are now on sale, letting you snag seats now for the December 16 premiere. The newest Star Wars movie is also the first to step outside the main plot line revolving around Luke, Han, Leia and their family, with a plot that details the steps taken to retrieve the plans for the first Death Star, which acts as the prime motivating plot device at the beginning of Episode IV.

There’s a new trailer forRogue One, too – and this one reveals a bit more of the lighter side of the film, with multiple genuinely funny moments that signal it probably will fit right in with the main series in terms of its blend of action, adventure and clever one-liners.
