Deborah Anderson-Bialis to discuss fertility startup solutions at Disrupt SF

Deborah Anderson-Bialis, the cofounder of pregnancy-focused tech startupFertilityIQ, is coming to Disrupt SF.

After spending three years and over $70,000 to get pregnant, Anderson-Bialis and her partner Jake Bilas cofounded FertilityIQ, a centralized place for people to get reviews and insight on fertility doctors. The startup has also beenbilled as a Yelp for fertility treatments, and is known for conducting a data-based study about factors that contribute to higher rates of IVF success.

In addition to heading up FertilityIQ, Anderson-Bialis studied law at University of California, Berkeley and volunteers her services in divorce cases for low-income families and victims of domestic violence.

Anderson-Bialis will be joining us at TechCrunch Disrupt in SF this September to discuss fertility-related solutions, the role of data in the fertility space, and what it’s like to be a startup disrupting a market driven by antiquated research.

Early Bird tickets are available now. We hope you canmake it out to the event.
