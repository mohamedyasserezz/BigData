Acer’s new 15-inch Chromebook promises 12 hours of battery life at $199

If nothing else, you can’t really argue with the price. Announced this morning, the latest version of Acer’s 15.6-inch Chromebook gets a couple of key upgrades over its predecessor, but none might be quite as welcome as the fact that the company has dropped its starting price by $50, down to $199.

The other key feature here – as with all Chromebooks – is battery life. The company is promising an impressive 12 hours of battery life on a charge for the Chrome OS notebook – that’s an increase of three hours over previous versions.

Otherwise, the specs are pretty similar to what you’ll find on the older model, including a 1366 x 768 display and a base level of 16GB of storage and 2GB of RAM on this base level version. That’s helped along by the 100GB of Google Storage space that comes along with the budget-minded device. All of that is upgradable at a cost, including the display, which bumps up to1920×1080.

The Chromebook is probably a bit too underpowered for most users to consider it a possible primary driver, but at around $200, it could prove a tempting secondary – or tertiary – computing device. You can pick one up nowfrom Wal-Mart, home of the $200 laptop.
