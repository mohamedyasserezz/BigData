Niantic acknowledges that Pokemon are way too hard to catch now, promises a fix

About two days ago, Pokemon Go players noticed a change — and it wasn’tone they’d been hoping for.

All of a sudden Pokemon were much,muchharder to catch. They dodged more, hopped over your ball more often, and worse yet, if youdidmanage to get one inside your Pokéball, odds were seemingly higher than ever that they’d bust out and immediately run away. Even the weakest stuff suddenly seemed painfully cunning; the low-level Weedles that new players once caught for practice suddenly became dastardly Pokeball-eating foes.

It would seem that Niantic is now aware of the issue and is working on a patch. They acknowledged the bug in a tweet:

Trainers, a new bug affecting throw accuracy increases the odds of escape and omits the XP bonus. We are working on a fix, stay tuned…

Alas, there’s no word onwhensuch a fix might come — but at least we can take some comfort in knowing that it’s not supposed to be like this:
