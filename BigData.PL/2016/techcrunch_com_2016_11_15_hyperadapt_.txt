Nike’s self-lacing shoes are coming soon, priced at $720

No one said living in the future was going to be cheap. And while they’re not quite as pricey as some estimates anticipated, getting your hands on a pair of Nike’s new self-lacing shoes is going to cost you a pretty penny – or, rather, 72,000 of them.

Even so, the newHyperAdapt 1.0are going to be a heck of a lot easier to get your hands on than the ultra-exclusive Back to the Future tie-ins the company raffled off recently. Starting December 1, you’ll be able to roll into Nike’s two retail shops in New York City to pick up a pair of the black/white models.

Wider availability arriving later in the month (along with a second color offering) through the Nike+ app and more retail locations – though the specifics around all of that are still forthcoming.

The company will also be letting a small number of Nike+ members reserve a pair through its app starting November 28 – consider it an early holiday present.

Our own Anthony Ha had the opportunity to try them ona few months back, because he gets to do all the fun stuff. Here’s what he had to say,

It’s fun but also surprisingly normal to feel them automatically tightening around your feet. (And the sound the laces made as they adjusted themselves made just as strong an impression.) They tightenedjust enough— they were pretty comfortable, so I only fiddled with the settings to see if I could.
