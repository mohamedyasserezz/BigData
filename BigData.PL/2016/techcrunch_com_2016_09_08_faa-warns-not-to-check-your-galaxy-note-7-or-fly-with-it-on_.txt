FAA warns not to check your Galaxy Note 7 or fly with it on

An exploding phone is by no means a good thing, but if it has to explode, it’s hard to think of a worse place for it to do so than on a plane. Well, notthathard, but it’s definitely a bad one. In the wake of the occasional combusting Galaxy Note 7 and itssubsequent recall, the FAA has advised passengers to exercise caution when flying with the device.

The administration ruined Samsung’s afternoonwith just 42 words:

In light of recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung about its Galaxy Note 7 devices, the Federal Aviation Administration strongly advises passengers not to turn on or charge these devices on board aircraft and not to stow them in any checked baggage.

They didn’t even issue a statement like this when hoverboards were blowing up left and right — of course, airlines ended up banning them anyway. No word yet from the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which does the official recalls for troublesome devices like this.

Please, Galaxy Note 7 owners. Fly safe, and if you haven’t already started the process of swapping in your device for a new, less inflammable one,do so today.
