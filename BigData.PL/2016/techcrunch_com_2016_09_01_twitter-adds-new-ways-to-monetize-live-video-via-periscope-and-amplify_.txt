Twitter adds new ways to monetize live video via Periscope

Twitter announced a new monetization option today, adding live Periscope content to its monetization options, which lets approved creators and brands earn a share of ad revenue on their media posts. Including live content produced via Periscope in the program is new, and the first partners to take advantage are Chase and Grey Goose, which are creating broadcasts with tennis legend Andy Roddick to coincide with the U.S. Open.

Roddick will be tweeting his broadcast to followers using the #USOpen hashtag, and he’ll be offering up commentator-style perspective on matches, with the aim of supplementing the actual live broadcast of the tournament itself. He’ll also be fielding Q&A from his audience, again transmitted live via Periscope and Twitter.

It’s a pilot example case designed to help illustrate how brands and other content creators might be able to take advantage of Periscope as a mechanism for delivering sponsored content and reaping the reward in the form of shared revenue.

Twitter claims an “industry leading” revenue share arrangement with participating content creators, but doesn’t specify the actual numbers behind the breakdown. ACNBC report claimsa roughly 70-30 split in the creator’s favor, citing an anonymous source.
