This crazy mod shaves off the edges of the iPhone using gigantic saw and belt sander

Who says you can’t physically mod an iPhone? This video shows it’s still possible. Using an industrial saw and massive belt sander, this guy shaves off just enough of his iPhone 7’s edge to make the sides flat. And you know what? It looks rad. Removing the rounded edges gives the iPhone 7 an industrial look — good luck finding a case that fits, though.

The video shows the steps and, with the right setup, this mod would be possible in most home workshops. Don’t have a gigantic, computer controlled saw? Use a table saw and crosscut sled. The results should be the same. Or you could ruin the phone.
