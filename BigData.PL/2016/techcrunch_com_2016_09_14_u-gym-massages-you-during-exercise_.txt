U-Gym massages you during exercise

I’m a big fan of massages, so I stopped dead in my tracks when I came across a company in the TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2016 Startup Alley earlier today. Taiwan-basedU-Gymis a deep layer muscle massager that you can wear while exercising.

U-Gym uses medium-frequency electrotherapy to stimulate your muscles, nerves and meridians. The company says it can help with muscle stiffness and soreness and speed up muscle recovery.

Right now, the company is selling its product out of Taiwan but plans to expand into U.S. territory within the next 12 months.

I was able to try out the U-Gym muscle massager, and it was pretty cool. Check it out below.
