NASA and Apple enlist Weezer and Trent Reznor to make music about Jupiter

With theJuno missionset to arrive at Jupiter on the Fourth of July, NASA did what any reasonable space agency would to celebrate the momentous occasion, teaming with Apple to release a short film and enlisting artists like Weezer and Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor to celebrate.

A short film,Visions of Harmony, has been released through iTunes, featuring some stunning visuals and celebrating connections between space exploration and music making.

Reznor and frequent collaborator Atticus Ross have crafted a soundtrack for the short, a nine-minute chilled out ambient tune inspired by electromagnetic sounds emitted by the solar system’s largest planet.

Weezer, meanwhile, has opted to go a more charged up, patriotic route, in honor of the Independence Day timing with the extremely unsubtle track, “I love the USA.” As a wise man once said, “We will not vanish without a fight! We’re going to live on! We’re going to survive! Today we celebrate our Independence Day!”

Congratulations Juno. Keep on rockin’ in the free world.
