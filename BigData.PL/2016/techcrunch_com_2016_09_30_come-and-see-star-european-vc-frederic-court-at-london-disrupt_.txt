Come and see star European VC Frederic Court at London Disrupt

The UK — and London specifically — is thought by many to be the capital of the European tech industry, not just because of its size and the number of startups based here, but because of the fact that a lot of the big financing starts and finishes here, too. The Brexit vote in the UK has arguably thrown that title and position up into the air, and many are now looking to see which way they will fall.

One person who will have an essential point of view on the subject isFrederic Court, a venture capitalist who over the years has backed some of the most successful exits of any European VC, and now runs his own firm, Felix Capital.He will be speaking at this year’s London Disrupt, and if you are interested in hearing about how a top VC in Europe (specifically London) views the state of the market today in the wider region and tech as a whole — you won’t want to miss him.

Court has been led by a wide-ranging investment philosophy, and he has backed startups in sectors varying from enterprise social media services through to a very heavy emphasis on fashion and e-commerce. Court himself is French, lived for a time in New York and is now mainly based out of London, and that well-travelled perspective follows through in his investments, which also span the globe. Companies in hiscurrent Felix portfolioinclude Goop, Farfetch, Olapic and Deliveroo.

We’re getting closer to the big week in December, when Disrupt makes its way to London for an exciting four days that include our Hackathon, famous Startup Battlefield pitch-off, and a program of amazing speakers. Find out more and get your ticketshere.
