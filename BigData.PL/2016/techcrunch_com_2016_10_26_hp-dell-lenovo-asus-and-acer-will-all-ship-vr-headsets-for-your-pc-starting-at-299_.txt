HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus and Acer will all ship VR headsets for your PC starting at $299

Microsoft is currentlyholding a press conferencein New York. The company is focusing a lot on 3D and all sorts of realities, from augmented reality to virtual reality. As part of this big push, Microsoft announced that it is partnering with five different brands that will all ship VR headsets for the next Windows 10 update.

Microsoft said that HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus and Acer are all working on tethered VR headsets for your PC with six degrees of freedom sensors. It means that you won’t need external sensors or a big room like with the HTC Vive. And these headsets will start at $299.

Watch out, Oculus and HTC as OEMs are coming after you. Microsoft and its partners are quickly turning VR headsets into commodity items. And this could be a breath of fresh air for virtual reality as a whole.

TheWindows 10 Creators Updateis coming next spring, so you can expect to buy these headsets early next year when Microsoft ships this update. The company also demoed Windows 10 apps in virtual reality. You can interact with apps that are projected on a wall in a virtual space.

But that’s not all. As you know, Microsoft is also working on the HoloLens, an augmented reality headset that lets you view virtual 3D objects and animations on top of the real world. The company demoed Microsoft Edge in the HoloLens.

With the headset, you can grab a 3D object onHouzzand project it in your living room. For instance, it’s a good way to see if these chairs will look good in your living room. This has been a common application for augmented reality apps on your smartphone. But it’s true that the HoloLens integration looks neat.

Microsoft also introduced a new HoloTour app. Despite the name, this app makes more sense with a VR headset. It lets you travel around the world and look at monuments as if you were right in front of them. This looks similar to the Google Cardboard app.
