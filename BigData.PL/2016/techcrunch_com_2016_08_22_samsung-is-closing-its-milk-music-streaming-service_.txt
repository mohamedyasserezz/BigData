Samsung is closing its Milk Music streaming service

Samsung will close its U.S. mobile music service — Milk Music — next month.

Milk Music launched in 2014as a service that is exclusively for Samsung devices, but has struggled to gain traction in the competitive space of music streaming. It used to include video, until that component was shuttered last year, butthe VR element of Milkwill leave on.

There’s been plenty of speculation around the future of Milk Music, which is much like Pandora, in recent times. Earlier this year,Samsung denied that it would offload the serviceby selling it to Tidal, the streaming service owned by rapper Jay-Z, so its eventual closure isn’t a huge surprise.

Samsung’s new strategy is to lean on existing music services, which is pretty logical when you consider (a) the vast sums of money being invested into streaming services (b) the competition, which includes Apple, Spotify, Google and others.

“We have made the strategic decision to invest in a partner model focused on seamlessly integrating the best music services available today into our family of Galaxy devices. We believe that working with partners will accelerate innovation, enhance device sales and provide amazing new experiences for our customers,”Samsung said in a blog post.

Milk Music was never launched outside of the U.S., which is fairly indicative of its lack of adoption. The service will officially be shuttered on September 22.
