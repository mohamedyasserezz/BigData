EY’s Jeff Wong brings startups into the boardroom

We had a far reaching-conversation but what I really wanted to know is why a young person leaving college should go work for EY rather than a startup? His answer? EY has seen an uptick in applications for employment and he sees the corporate world as one where the most change can be done with the most resources.
