Hackers post White House staffer’s private emails

More White House staffer emails have been leaked,Politico reports, this time from the compromised private Gmail account of an employee who seemed to handle travel and other day-to-day scheduling and logistics tasks. The dump, which was posted to DCLeaks, includes what looks like a digital scan of first lady Michelle Obama’s passport.

The fresh leak follows the release of a number of former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell’s emails, which occurred earlier this month. The emails may be from a fresh hack, or could be let over from previous attacks. DCLeaks has been identified as aRussian-backed attempt to influence U.S. political processes by some digital security analysts.
