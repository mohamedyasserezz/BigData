GoPro releases the $299 Karma Grip handheld stabilizer

The GoPro Karma Grip is now available. The camera maker announced today that the handheld stabilizer is for sale in select stores and GoPro.com for $299. This is the same handheld grip that shipped with theKarma drone— at least before the dronewas recalledfor battery issues.

The Karma Grip competes directly with the DJI Osmo though both offer distinct advantages as I and. TechCrunch video correspondent found in testing. We took both products with us to South Korea and put them through their paces. The DJI Osmo offers more controls that video enthusiasts are probably looking for but the GoPro Karma Grip, when used with the Hero 5, has superior video quality. The Karma Grip feels like it can take more abuse than the Osmo.

I’ve found the Karma Grip has encouraged me to dig out my older GoPro cameras. The stabilization makes a large difference in picture quality.

The Karma Grip doesn’t ship with a camera. Instead, it’s available at $299 and buyers need to provide their own camera. It works with the Hero 5 and Hero 4 Black and Silver. GoPro says the Hero 5 Session will be compatible with the Karma Grip in the second quarter of 2017.

The Grip ships with a case and bevy of accessories. At $299, the Karma Grip is good value for owners of a Hero 4 camera. But at $299 plus the cost of a GoPro camera (the Hero 5 is $399), the value diminishes.

TechCrunch asked GoPro for an update on the availability of the Karma drone. The company did not provide a statement. Early last month, just 18 days after its release andon the same day I published my review, GoProrecalled all of the Karma drones.
