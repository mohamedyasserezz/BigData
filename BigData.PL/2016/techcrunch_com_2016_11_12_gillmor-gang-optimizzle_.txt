Gillmor Gang: Optimizzle

The Gillmor Gang â€” Keith Teare, Frank Radice, and Steve Gillmor. Recorded live Friday, November 11, 2016. McLuhan said the medium is the message. Our next President agreed, and decided Twitter is the medium. Plus the latest G3 (below) with Halley Suitt Tucker, Mary Hodder, Elisa Camahort Page, and Tina Chase Gillmor.
