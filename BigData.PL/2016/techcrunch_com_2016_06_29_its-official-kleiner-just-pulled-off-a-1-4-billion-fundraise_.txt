It’s official: Kleiner just pulled off a $1.4 billion fundraise

So much for losing its mojo.

Despitetwistsandturnsin recent years that have sometimes rivaled those of a telenovela, and even with its most famous member, John Doerr,no longer a general partner, Kleiner Perkins has raised two new funds totaling $1.4 billion, show newly processed SEC filings.

The firm’s digital growth fund — its third — has secured$1 billionin commitments. The capital will be managed by Mary Meeker, Ted Schlein, Mood Rowghani and Noah Knauf, who very recently joined Kleiner from Warburg Pincus.

Kleiner’s newest (17th!) early-stage fund, meanwhile, has closed with$400 millionin commitments. As you’ve read here recently, Kleiner’s early-stage team now features five general partners: Schlein, Mike Abbott, Eric Feng, Beth Seidenberg and Wen Hsieh.

For those keeping track, in addition to Doerr, Randy Komisar has also stepped back as a general partner. Feng, who weinterviewed recently, explained to us that Komisar is now largely coaching Kleiner’s current crop of GPs.
