Three years later, Dropcam Pros get updated to handle 1080p

If you own a Dropcam Pro (the last model Dropcam shipped before it was bought by Nest): surprise! It can now do 1080p recording.

Previously capped at 720p, Nest had long promised that 1080p support was on the way for the Dropcam Pro. Hell, even the Dropcam Pro’s box said it supported 1080p!

When Nest eventually shipped a 1080p Nest Cam, many figured the long-promised update would never come.

But sure enough: nearly three years after Dropcam Pro’s debut, Nest tells me they’ve just shipped a new build of the Nest app to the app stores, and that it turns on 1080p playback for Dropcam Pro owners.
