And the winner of Startup Battlefield at Disrupt London 2016 is… Seenit

At the very beginning, there were 14 startups. After two days of incredibly fierce competition, we now have a winner.

Startups participating in theStartup Battlefieldhave all been hand-picked to participate in our highly competitive startup competition. They all presented in front of multiple groups of VCs and tech leaders serving as judges for a chance to win £40,000 and the coveted Disrupt Cup.

After hours of deliberations, TechCrunch editors pored over the judges’ notes and narrowed the list down to six finalists:InsideDNA,LiftIgniter,Oxehealth,PhenixP2PandSeenit.

These startups made their way to the finale to demo in front of our final panel of judges, which included: Judges:Barbara Belvisi(Hardware Club),Luciana Lixandru(Accel),Sean O’Sullivan(SOSV),Matthew Panzarino(TechCrunch) andFrancesca Warner(Downing Ventures).
