More Android devices are running Gingerbread than Nougat 7.0

Slowly but surely, the news of Nougat updates are starting to roll in. The OnePlus 3 and Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge will be getting beta versions in the near future, and ZTE recently announced an update for the Axon 7 arriving in January.

But aside from some high profile devices like the LG V20, Google’s own Pixel (which sports the new 7.1) and some newer Nexus devices, the operating system has been slow to join its brethren since its unveiling back in late-August.

It’s tough to look at the latestnumbers from the Android Developers Dashboardwithout muttering the mobile OS F-word (rhymes with “lagmentation,” a word I just made up). The stats were collected during a week-long period ending November 7 by recording devices running the Google Play Store app — which is included on versions 2.2 and later.

At the moment, combined versions of Lollipop command 34.1 percent of distribution. Version 4.4 (KitKat) is next up at 25.2-percent, with Marshmallow’s 24-percent following close behind – a marked jump since mid-year, when it was at around 7.5.

Its successor, on the other hand, is currently around 0.3-percent, putting Nougat 7.0 between Froyo’s 0.1 percent and Gingerbread’s 1.3. For the time being, the Pixel’s 7.1 doesn’t appear on the list at all, owing perhaps to the footnote that, “Any versions with less than 0.1-percent distribution are not shown.”
