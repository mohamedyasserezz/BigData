Ex-GV CEO Bill Maris said to be launching health care investment fund, Section 32

Section 32, the new healthcare-focused venture fund reportedly being launched by Bill Maris, was apparently named in homage to Section 31, an intelligence agency from the Star Trek universe. If that’s not a bit of pre-emptive nerd cred, I don’t know what is.

According toa report from Recode, the GV (nee Google Ventures) founder/former-CEO is raising $230 million for the project, focused on various health care investments. Details about the fund are pretty scarce at the moment, and Maris isn’t ready to talk yet, but information is coming from unnamed sources who had a peek at the Section 32 fundraising deck.

The fund will reportedly be run directly by Maris and primarily based out of San Diego. The exec left GVback in August, after helping lead investments in some key startups including Nest, Uber and Jet.com. In fact, he apparently made his exit because everything was going so swimming. “GV is seen as a premier venture capital operation around the world,” he said at the time. “If it weren’t in great shape, that would be the wrong time to leave. I’m leaving because everything is great.”

He’s remained busy in the meantime, with rumors surrounding fundraising efforts surfacing asearly as September.

Update:Maris apparentlythought betterof the whole fund raising undertaking. “[S]taring down the barrel of doing again exactly what I just did was not inspiring me, and I pulled the plug. Life is too short to not be true to yourself. I’m still taking time off and exploring some other ideas that may be more fun and impactful.”
