The first episode of the MegaBots webseries takes a wrecking ball to its six-ton robot

Seems like we’ve been waiting forever for the big showdown between Team USA and Japan. We’re seemingly no closer at the moment, but at least the team at MegaBots can offer a bit of good old-fashioned destruction to tide  us over before the massive machines go toe-to-toe.

In the premier of its new web series (the trailer for whichwas shown off at Disruptthe other week), the team behind the fighting robot startup league go to town on their own robot, the $200,000 Mk. II.

In order to stress test the six-ton bot’s protective casing, the team shoots it with its own gun and gives it several whacks with a wrecking ball. At the risk of spoiling the seven-and-a-half minute long video, it turns out it’s really tough to knock over a 15-foot-tall fighting robot.

The new series sports some high production values (including the aforementioned $200k robot) for a YouTube exclusive, following the team as it designs its latest bot in the lead up to its face off with Japan’s Suidobashi Heavy Industry.
