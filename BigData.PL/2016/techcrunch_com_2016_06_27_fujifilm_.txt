Fujifilm finally updates its smartphone photo printer

It’s been a long time coming, but Fujifilm’s finally ready to offer up the sequel to its Instax Share Smartphone Printer SP-1. Two-and-a-half years after debuting the peripheral at CES, the company returns this week with the fittingly namedInstax Share SP-2, which promises some key improvements over its warmly received predecessor.

Chief among the updates is a bump in speed, knocking the 16-second Wi-Fi print time for a credit-card sized photo down to a more manageable 10 seconds, freeing up valuable time to finally finish the novel you’ve been working on for the better part of a decade. The photos also feature improved resolution, bumping it up to 320 DPI, along with a higher contrast.

Speaking of which, the custom filter lets users adjust contrast, brightness, saturation and the like, and the collage template makes it possible to combine multiple images into one, just as the name implies.

The product’s design has also gotten a bit of an overhaul for a more “sophisticated appearance” that’s available in gold and silver – the most sophisticated of colors. The SP-2 also features a built-in battery rechargeable via microUSB.

It’s arriving next month for $199, with a double pack of the compatible instant film running $20.
