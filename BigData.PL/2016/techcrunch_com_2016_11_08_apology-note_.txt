Samsung is really, really sorry about the Galaxy Note 7 and plans to ‘do better’

Samsung is no doubt eager to put this whole Note 7 situation behind it as quickly as possible. In fact, the company apparently can’t stop talking up the Galaxy S8, even though that device is still a few months over the horizon.

But of the seven stages of exploding smartphone grief, Samsung is currently on the apology tour part, issuing an open letter to readers both on its site and throughfull-page adsin a number of major US newspapers, including The New York Times, The Washington PostandThe Wall Street Journalon Monday.

Themessage on Samsung’s siteis addressed to its “valued customers.” While it doesn’t address any of the recent concerns around the recall of some 2.8 million top-loading washing machines, it does touch on the company’s plans to “do better,” moving forward, including a continued investigation into precisely what caused dozens of devices to malfunction.

“Samsung has a long heritage of innovation and we have shown that we can and will learn from our mistakes,” the company writes. “While we are always looking to innovate and create the next generation of great consumer technology, safety will remain our top priority. We will invest to better serve your needs through enhanced customer care and quality assurance.”

The letter on Samsung’s site is address directly to European consumers. Different wings of the company have been looking toward various actions to take the remaining Galaxy Note devices in the wild out of commission, from cutting off access to cell towers in New Zealand to a software update that won’t let units charge past 60-percent.
