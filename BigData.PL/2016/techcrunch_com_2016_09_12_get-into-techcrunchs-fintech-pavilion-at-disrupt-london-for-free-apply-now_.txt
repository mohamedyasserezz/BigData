Get into TechCrunch’s Fintech Pavilion at Disrupt London for free — Apply now

Great tech talent, an excellent regulatory environment and a world-class city has turned London into the fintech capital of the world. And there’s a boom on. UK fintech firms secured $5.4 billion of the $49.7 billion of global investment in financial tech between 2010 and 2015, compared with the total $4.4 billion raised across the rest of Europe, according to research from Fintech Week London. Transferwise, Currency Cloud and Seedrs are among the stars of the scene.

So it makes sense for TechCrunch to allocate a special fintech space at TechCrunch’s upcomingDisrupt London, 5-6 December.

We will host a startup pavilion for Fintech companies. Because there are lots of very early stage startups in Fintech, we are offering five companies in each category the chance to exhibit free of charge.
