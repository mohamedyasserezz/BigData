Come see Boston Dynamics and its robots stomp on the Disrupt London stage

If artificial intelligence will inevitably be a central part of how we will interact with machines and services in the future, then learning more about who is developing these new AI systems — and what they are making — is essential to us understanding and helping shape that world.

And you, dear reader, will have a chance to do exactly that next month, when Marc Raibert, the founder ofBoston Dynamics, one of the most interesting robotics companies out there today, speaks at Disrupt, our flagship conference in London taking place December 5-6, and brings some of his robots along for the ride.

If there were a prize for the company that could best lay claim to the term “disruptor”, Boston Dynamics would definitely make the shortlist, if not win the whole thing hands down.

The company has alternatelyamazedandterrifiedpeople with its videos showing off its latest robots, creatures that roughly take the shape of humans and dogs and are able to scale snowy terrains, get up when they fall down, and do a number of tasks.

There are literally dozens of components that go into AI systems — from computer vision and machine learning systems to process the world and decide what to do, through to the hardware mechanics to execute those decisions — and Boston Dynamics is one of the few synthesizing all of them in one place successfully, which begs all kinds of questions about what these robotscoulddo in a few years’ time, versus what theyshouldbe doing.

And Boston Dynamics has been a party to other kinds of disruption, too. It wasacquiredby Google in 2013 and is now a part of its Alphabet business — albeit, it seems,with some catches.

Join us at Disrupt to hear the latest on all of this, and to see some of Boston Dynamics’ robots for yourself.
