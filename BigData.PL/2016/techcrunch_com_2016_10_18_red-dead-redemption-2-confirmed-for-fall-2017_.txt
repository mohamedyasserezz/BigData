Red Dead Redemption 2 confirmed for Fall 2017

Rockstar games confirmed a sequel to Red Dead Redemption is on the way for release in Fall 2017, tweeting the date along with the promise of a trailer arriving this Thursday, October 20. The follow-up to Rockstar’s epic Western action-adventure game series has beenteased through Rockstar’s account, leaving many to suspect a sequel was planned, but now we know for sure.

The image accompanying today’s news features a closer look at the seven cowboys featured in an image posted yesterday. They look like a band of outlaws if I ever seen one.

At a landing page for the upcoming game, Rockstar also provided a bit more detail about the upcoming Red Dead Redemption 2, noting that it’s “an epic tale of life in America’s unforgiving heartland,” with a “vast and atmospheric world.”  The most pertinent info is that the game will play host to a whole new online multiplayer game mode, which will likely be much more ambitious than the online play in the original Red Dead Redemption. It’ll probably look very similar to the online play in GTA V, if I had to guess, since that’s been such an ongoing success for Rockstar.

PlayStation 4 and Xbox One platform support are both also mentioned on the teaser site. The trailer lands in two days, as mentioned, so tune in for that big reveal. Can’t wait to get back in the saddle.
