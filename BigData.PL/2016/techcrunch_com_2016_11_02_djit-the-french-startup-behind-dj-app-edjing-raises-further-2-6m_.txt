DJiT, the French startup behind DJ app edjing, raises further $2.6M

Paris-basedDJiT, the French startup behind the popular DJ app edjing and, more recently, a hardware device called Mixfader, has raised a further $2.6 million.

The new round of funding — its first since raising $2.5 millionback in late 2013— was led byXLR CapitalandBpifrance, along with participation from a number of individuals. They include Jean-Charles Carré, manager of David Guetta, and DJ and producer Martin Solveig, who also join DJiT’s new advisory board.

Stéphane Bohbot, founder of Innov8 Group, also invested and is being namechecked specifically for his expertise in retail and connected objects, something that the startup hopes to leverage as it seeks growth through hardware, not just software.

To that end, DJiT says it plans to use the additional capital to enlarge its product range, develop its international partners network and to accelerate ongoing sales negotiations.

That should see it get Mixfader, its connected hardware mixing and “scratching” device, into more European stores beyond the company’s own internationalized website and existing partnerships with French stores Boulanger, Colette, Lick and Fnac.

Jean-Baptiste Hironde, CEO of DJiT, says in a statement: “Our ambition is to make DJiT the first app and physical products ecosystem fully dedicated to music. This strategy led us to be one of the best candidate to become the first French unicorn of the music sector.”
