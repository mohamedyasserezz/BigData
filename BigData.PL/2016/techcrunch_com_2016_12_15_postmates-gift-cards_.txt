Postmates launches virtual gift cards

On-demand startup Postmates justlaunched virtual gift cards, which you can purchase in amounts of $25, $50, $100 or $200. There’s no expiration date, and they can be used at any store on Postmates, which is pretty cool for the recipient because it means they can buy just about anything — and get it delivered on demand — on someone else’s dime.

Postmates is by no means the first on-demand company to sell gift cards. Lyft first startedselling physical gift cards at Starbucks in AugustandUber started selling them in September, both as virtual and physical cards sold in 35,000 retail locations throughout the U.S. like Walmart, Target and CVS.

Back in October,Postmates raised $140 millionled by Founders Fund, with participation from existing investors. As of that time, Postmates was completing over 1.5 million deliveries a month.
