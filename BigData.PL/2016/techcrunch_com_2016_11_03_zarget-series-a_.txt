Marketing and optimization startup Zarget raises $6M

Zargetannouncedyesterdaythat it has raised $6 million in Series A funding.

Co-founder and CEO Arvind Parthiban said Zarget’s goal is to build a full suite of products for small businesses to track and optimize websites — one that could be used by “a tech-savvy marketer like me, without any coding skills.”

The product’s capabilities include A/B testing, heatmaps, funnel analytics, user polls and feedback. There’s alsoa Google Chrome plug-inthat allows customers to access Zarget while viewing their website.

Parthiban contrasted this with most existing solutions, where you need to buy an A/B testing product, a heatmap product and so on. He said Zarget has more than 1,000 customers.

The round was led by Sequoia India, with participation from previous backers Accel and Matrix Partners. Future plans include adding support for mobile apps and for personalization.
