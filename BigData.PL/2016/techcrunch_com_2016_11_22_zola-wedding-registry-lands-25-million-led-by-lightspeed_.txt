Zola wedding registry lands $25 million led by Lightspeed

Zola, the smarter wedding gift registry, has signed term sheets on a $25 million Series C round of funding, according to sources close to the matter. Sources say that Lightspeed led the round, and that Zola’s pre-funding valuation was at $200 million.

Zola is an online wedding registry that lets couples choose products from a number of brands and even set up a cash fund.

Guests can purchase products on a couples’ Zola page and have them sent directly to the couple, avoiding the hassle of going into a store that already has a registry and dealing with the mess of gift wrapping, transportation, etc. Zola ties in with existing brands but also lets users import products from other sites to add to their registry.

Plus, the Zola couple can choose when their products arrive or convert their gifts into Zola store credit.

Both Zola and Lightspeed declined to comment on this story.
