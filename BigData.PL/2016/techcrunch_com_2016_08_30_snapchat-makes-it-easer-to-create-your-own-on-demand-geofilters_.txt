Snapchat makes it easier to create your own On-Demand Geofilters

On-Demand Geofilters from Snapchat let anyone build a custom filter for their event (or for whatever reason – I’m not judging your Snapchat filter needs), which was a petty good idea when theoffering launched back in February. Today it becomes an even better idea, thanks to new templates that let users create their own customized geofilters without any special knowledge of Photoshop, Illustrator or any graphics software at all.

If you’re looking to buy a geofilter, Snapchat will now provide templates right on the On-Demand website itself, offering  a variety of themes, as well as customizable text and color options. Top-level category options let you choose between “Birthdays,” “Celebrations” and “Weddings,” which then leads you to a selection of overlay graphics choices, a color palette picker and the ability to insert text or even upload your own images. The workflow then takes you through choosing your tie frame and the area you want to cover before letting you confirm and check out.

Before, the only option was to upload your own artwork, which is not necessarily an accessible activity to a wide group of users. Snapchat clearly doesn’t want to limit the appeal of this offering, given its pricing; Geofilter costs start at just $5 depending on how big of an area you want to cover, and how long you want the filter to last. This big improvement is making something from scratch and definitely goes a long way to broadening its appeal.

My only real worry now that it’s this easy to create custom Snapchat geofilters is that I’ll bankrupt myself trying to troll my friends.
