Alexa will warm Eight’s new Smart Mattress

Up to now, sleep has been the one place you could reliably go to escape technology. But it was only a matter of time, really, before that window closed for good. Eight, a sleep technology startup out of New York, is launching a smart mattress, so you can keep yourself connected to the internet of things while you’re catching some Zs.

As you’d expect, the simply namedSmart Mattressdoes your standard sleep tracking – monitoring moving and breathing rate to determine when you’re asleep and what stage of sleep you’re in, tracking sleep scores over time and offering up tips through its proprietary app. That sleep data can also be exported to Apple and Google’s health apps.

The smartphone alarm app can also be tailored to wake you at the ideal time during your cycle. The bed also warms both sides individually and has a built-in white noise generator to lull you to sleep.

The bed also integrates itself right into a home automation system, communicating with smart coffee makers and Philips Hue lights, so you really don’t have to do much of anything at all when you wake up in the morning. You can also use Alexa to warm the bed without pressing a button.

The bed is available now through Eight’s site, starting at $950 for a full.
