Gillmor Gang: Reality Bites

The Gillmor Gang â€” Robert Scoble, Keith Teare, Frank Radice, Kevin Marks, and Steve Gillmor. Recorded live Saturday, December 10, 2016. Augmented reality meets the Beatles, Twitter-in-chief, Netflix does downloads, Snap go the Glasses, and Apple floats a two week window. What, no Mitt Romney?
