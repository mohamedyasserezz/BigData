Microsoft had the best month for consumer Surface sales, partially credits MacBook ‘disappointment’

According to Microsoft, November marked the company’s best month for consumer Surface sales by volume (a list that excludes Surface Hub electronic whiteboard). The ever-growing line’s pre-holiday success was no doubt due in no small part to the recent arrival of the refreshed Surface Book and the brand new Surface Studio, the swiveling all-in-one that marks one of the more exciting pieces of consumer hardware from the company in recent months. That began shipping to pre-order customers late last month.

Of course, Apple announced its own long-awaited notebook refresh the same week. The new Touch Bar MacBook Pro got a decidedly mixed reception during its late-October launch, with Phil Schillertelling the pressthat Apple’s “online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before,” shortly after launch.

Still, Microsoft is more than happy to chalk up the recent success of its proprietary hardware line in part to unhappy Apple fans. In ablog post today, the company creditedits cheeky trade-inprogram with some of the success:

Our trade-in program for MacBooks was our best ever, and the combination of excitement for the innovation of Surface coupled with the disappointment of the new MacBook Pro — especially among professionals — is leading more and more people to make the switch to Surface[… ] It seems like a new review recommending Surface over MacBook comes out daily. This makes our team so proud, because it means we’re doing good work.

The new Surface Book with Performance Base has added Australia and New Zealand to its list of available markets, with Austria, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Switzerland and the U.K. available coming early next quarter.
