Co-founder of Marketo raises $22 million for his new marketing startup, Engagio

Jon Miller is hoping lightning can strike twice in the marketing space.

After the success of his previous marketing automation company, Marketo, Miller is returning to the world of targeted marketing tools with Engagio, which just raised $22 million in its latest round of funding.

The Series B round, led by Norwest Venture Partners, with participation from FirstMark Capital and Storm Ventures will be used to grow the new business.

Iterating on his previous company’s technology, Miller has turned his attention to a more targeted approach of managing the marketing campaigns that companies use to win new customers.

Instead of marketing to a broad set of potential customers, Engagio claims that its software can help manage the process of approaching a particular customer, with a campaign that’s targeted more specifically to that potential client’s needs.

It’s a layer of management software that would slot in to existing marketing toolkits from companies like Salesforce to coordinate outreach attempts to those companies that a business has targeted as potential customers.

Based in San Mateo, Engagio has signed up 50 customers for its services and has managed to put much of Miller’s Marketo band back together to round out its executive staff.

“Engagio is empowering its customers to identify and focus their selling efforts on high-value accounts by involving everyone who plays a part in the customer journey,” said Sean Jacobsohn, partner at Norwest Venture Partners in a statement. “This allows companies to orchestrate multi-step plays that engage target accounts across departments and channels, including email, phone, social, and demand generation.”
