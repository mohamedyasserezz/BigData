VR filmmaking could use some more big-name talent, andILMxLAB‘s latest project does indeed offer that: The director attached is Alejandro G. Iñárritu, the visionary behindThe RevenantandBirdman.

There’s not much we know about the untitled Iñárritu collaboration with ILM’s experimental VR and MR immersive filmmaking unit, butSlashfilmhas a few details, including that it’s going to be a short film which involves Oscar-winner Emmanuel Lubezki (who worked onGravity) helping with cinematography. The general plot will focus on the “intense and excruciating experience of a group of immigrants and refugees crossing the border between Mexico and the United States,” Slashfilm reports.

We had ILMxLAB’s Michael Koperwas and Diana Williams at TechCrunch Disrupt SF earlier this month (interview below), but they were tight-lipped about any upcoming projects, including David Goyer’sDarth Vader-centered VR story. Likely they’d rather wait until these things ship before revealing too much – ‘no spoilers’ is the ILM motto, after all.
