Mophie debuts a whole bunch of battery power banks with reduced price points

Mophie wants everyone to know that it’s more than just battery cases — the company made as much extremely clear when we met to take a look at its new offerings. Not that it minds that its Juice Packs have become synonymous with the space, of course, but the company hastens to add that a big chunk of its products are the standalone variety.

And Mophie’s got a whole lot to offer on that front. During the aforementioned meeting, it showed off five different individual iterations on the fourth generation of its Powerstation line.

The biggest change this time around is a look toward affordability, something it admits it hadn’t paid particular attention to in some of its older products. The new line starts at a reasonable $30 and go up to around $100. The lower price is thanks, in part, to changes in manufacturing. While it insists that it hasn’t cut corners, the company explains that it’s found a method to make the things more cheaply.

The standard old fourth-gen Powerstation comes in four different sizes, ranging from the 3,000 mAh Mini to the massive 20,000 mAh XXL (which also sports three USB ports). For perspective, the iPhone 6s’ battery is 2750.

Also new is the Powerstation USB-C, which is pretty much what it sounds like (featuring a 10,000 mAh battery) and the wireless Qi-enabled Charge Force. There’s a new version of the PowerStation Plus with an integrated combo microUSB/Lighting charging cable. That one starts at $60.

The new Powerstations are available now through Mophie’s site.
