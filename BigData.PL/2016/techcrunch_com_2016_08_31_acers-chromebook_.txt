Acer’s new 13-inch Chromebook is also a convertible tablet

Still a few days out from the official kickoff of this year’s IFA conference in Berlin, but Acer’s kicking things off with a glut of product announcements. The company’s news largely revolves around its gaming offerings, but it also managed to sneak a new Chromebook into the proceedings.

The Chromebook R 13 features a 13-inch touchscreen display that clocks in at 1920×1080. The most notable feature on the thing, however, is a 360-degree hinge that turns the Chrome OS netbook into a convertible tablet – or doubles as a kickstand for watching movies and the like.

The Chromebook has a MediaTek quad-core processor and a battery that promises up to 12 hours of life on a charge, which I could have used on this red eye into Berlin (but I digress). There’s 4GB of RAM on board and three storage configurations: 16, 32 or 64GB.

It hits the US in October, starting at $399.
