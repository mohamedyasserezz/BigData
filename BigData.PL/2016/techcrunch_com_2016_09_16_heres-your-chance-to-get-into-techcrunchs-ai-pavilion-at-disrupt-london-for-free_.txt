Here’s your chance to get into TechCrunch’s AI Pavilion at Disrupt London for free

According to one estimate, there are roughly 900 tech companies working in the AI field, covering everything from business intelligence to finance and security. The AI gold rush started in 2014 with a flurry of deals into AI companies. Last year there were some 300 deals into AI companies according to CB Insights and in the UK alone, companies like Ravelin, Signal and Gluru raised seed rounds. So AI isn’t going anywhere and Europe’s traditional strong suit in pure maths and research should help the AI revolution there.

At TechCrunch’s upcomingDisrupt London, 5-6 December, artificial intelligence (AI) TechCrunch will host a startup pavilion for this exciting category. Because there are lots of very early stage startups in AI, we are offering five companies the chance to exhibit free of charge.

Here’s what exhibitors in the Disrupt London special pavilions for AI can expect:
