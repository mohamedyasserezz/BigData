Snapchat introduces Groups with up to 16 people, plus new creative tools

Snapchat has added some new features,including Groups, a new group chat that lets up to 16 friends share conversation and media. Group chats self-delete after 24 hours by default, and Snaps sent within a group can be opened only once, and replayed only once, by each member of the group, just like a regular Snap.

The new Group feature also includes an easy way to pop out to individual chat with anyone within the Group, letting you tap on any member’s name when they’re active in a chat and jump into a one-on-one conversation. All features supported in Chat are supported in Groups, including stickers, vote and video notes, Bitmoji and more.

Snapchat is also introducing new creative tools for use composing your Snaps. There are Scissors that let you snip out part of a Snap and make it into its own sticker, which will then be available in the sticker drawer. This is launching on iOS first, with an Android version coming later.

Also new is the addition of Paintbrush, a feature that you can use on any Snaps you have in memories, which works similar to how artistic filter apps like Prisma work. Also new is Shazam support, built right into the Snapchat camera, which lets you identify music playing right within the app.
