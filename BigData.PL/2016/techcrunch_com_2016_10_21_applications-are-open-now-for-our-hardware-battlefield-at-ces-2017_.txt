Applications are open now for our Hardware Battlefield at CES 2017

Do you make the hardest of things, hardware? We want you to compete in our Hardware Alley, our premier startup competition at CES 2017 in Las Vegas. You will have the chance to show your amazing products to representatives from major retailers, VCs, and other notables and you’ll climb far above the usual CES noise.

Hardware Battlefield is part of TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield series, but with a few small differences. We require that participating companies must have a hardware component to their product. That means everything from IoT devices to 3D printing, health wearables to drones are accepted. And, of course, robots.

Hardware Battlefield takes places at CES in Las Vegas, Nevada. Battlefield contestants still have six minutes to pitch to our judging panel followed by six minutes of live Q/A. Judges include hardware investors like Rob Coneybeer, Highway1 and HAX, top designers like Yves Behar and product experts like Susan Paley of GM. Martha Stewart and 50 Cent have also been known to stop by.

You can apply for the Battlefieldhere. The rules are simple: you need a functional prototype to show off at the show and you could win our coveted Metal Man prize and $50,000. It’s a great opportunity for a young and scrappy hardware company.

So apply today and we hope to see you on the ground in Vegas where (hardware) dreams really do come true.
