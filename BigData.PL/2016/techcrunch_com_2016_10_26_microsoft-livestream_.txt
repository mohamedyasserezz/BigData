Watch Microsoft’s Surface PC event live right here

Today’s Microsoft eventis kicking off bright and early — particularly for those in the company’s home timezone, where things start in earnest at 7 AM PT. Of course, we’ll be live at the press conference in New York City, covering the news as it happens, so for those a few hours behind, we’ll have all of the relevant information for you first thing in the morning.

For everyone in a more accommodating time zone (and those who like their Microsoft news piping hot like their Seattle coffee), you can watch the live stream right here on this page at7 AM Pacific, 10 AM Eastern, 4 PM Central European Time.

The press material is positioning this as a Windows 10-focused event, so we’ll probably be hearing quite a bit on the software front, including, most likely, thatfancy new version of MS Paintyou didn’t know you’ve been waiting for. Also, we hear tell that the company will be offering up some hardware at the event as well, including a new Surface device – just a little over a year after the release of the Surface Book.

Stay tuned for the latest.
