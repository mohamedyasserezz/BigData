HP’s new photo printer is almost as good as owning an instant camera

You could go in for the full-throated nostalgia of an instant printer like the Fujifilm Instax or that new dealie from Leica, or you can pick up one of these things and let your smartphone do all of the heavy lifting.

HP’s new Sprocketis a pint-sized affair, priced at $130 — $70 less than the long-awaited Fujifilm Instax Share SP-2 and about the same as the company’s Instax Mini 70 instant camera. The handheld peripheral is likely shorter that you smartphone, measuring in at 4.53 x 2.95 x 0.87 inches and weighing in at 0.38 pounds.

The Sprocket (confuse it with the Sprout at your own peril) connects to an iOS or Android device via Bluetooth or NFC, using the company’s app to print 2 x 3 photos or stickers from the handset or social media.

The system utilizes the ZINK (Zero Ink), dumping the need for printer cartridges in favor of heat- activated dye color crystals in the paper. The photo version of the printing paper runs $10 a pack. Paper and printer both are available now through HP’s site.
