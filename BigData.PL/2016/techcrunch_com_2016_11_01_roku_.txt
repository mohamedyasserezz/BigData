Roku’s latest OS update brings live TV pausing and private listening

Roku’s rolling out an update to its TV streaming operating system that brings a pair of important updates to its entire line of streaming players and TVs.

Most notable forRoku OS 7.5is the long-awaited addition of live TV pausing. So long as a Roku TV is connected to an antenna and a USB storage device with 16GB or more, users can pause live digital TV broadcasts to their heart’s content — or, rather, for up to 90 minutes.

The update also brings mobile private listening to all Roku TV models. Previously only available on limited Roku players, the update lets users stream audio on mobile devices, so they can listen to shows at ear-piecing volumes through the iOS or Android without bugging the people around them.

The point upgrade brings some other (slightly less exciting features) to the system, including the ability for friends to share photos on the set. The 7.5 roll out officially kicks off today, and Roku expects it to be fully completed by the time the holidays roll around. You can find the fullrundown of features here.
