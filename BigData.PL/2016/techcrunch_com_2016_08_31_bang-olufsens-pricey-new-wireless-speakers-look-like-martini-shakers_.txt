Bang & Olufsen’s pricey new wireless speakers look like martini shakers

If nothing else, Bang & Olufsen knows how to make an impression. The Danish audio company announced a pair of new wireless speakers — or rather, one speaker in two different sizes — with conical aluminium designs that, if nothing else, certainly stand out.

The BeoSound 1 and 2 (names, interestingly enough, already used for a pair of shiny multi-room speakers about 10 or so years back) offer up a slew of wireless connectivity options, including Google Cast, AirPlay, DNLA and, naturally, Bluetooth, pumping out 360-degree sound in the process.

The tops of the speakers are open for acoustic reasons, according to the company, and the metal shell doesn’t come in direct contact with the ground, so the bass gets a chance to escape from the bottom. There are also, interestingly, proximity sensors built in, popping up controls when a user is nearby.

As far as differences between the two systems, the 2 is the larger of the speakers and needs to be hardwired to operate.

The 1 and 2 feature Spotify and Deezer access without need for a mobile device, as well as TuneIn radio integration. The BeoSound 1 is available now, with the 2 arriving at the end of next month. And they’ll cost you, naturally, a jaw-dropping $1,495 and $1,895. That’s a lot of martinis.
