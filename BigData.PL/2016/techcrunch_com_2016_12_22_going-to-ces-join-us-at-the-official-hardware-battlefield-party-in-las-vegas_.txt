Going to CES? Join us at the official Hardware Battlefield Party in Las Vegas

There ainâ€™t no party like a TechCrunch party ðŸŽ‰ because at a TechCrunch party you can meet investors who may or may not give you a term sheet for your hardware startup ðŸ’°. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re inviting 150 lucky readers to our event in Las Vegas to be held in conjunction with CES and our own Hardware Battlefield.

Tickets will sell outsoon so click here right nowand reserve yours. Weâ€™re holding it at the Sayerâ€™s Club on January 6 from 6:30pm to 8:30pm and it should be a good opportunity to mingle with TC editorial and the Hardware Battlefield contestants.

Weâ€™ll see you Las Vegas and be sure to bring your dancing shoes and leave them in the hotel because this party will have no dancing â€“ only crackling, rapid-fire conversation about bills of materials, robotics, and local manufacturing.
