Niantic confirms new Pokémon are coming

“Keep an eye out on our social media channels on December 12th for details about the first addition of more Pokémon into Pokémon GO,”said the company statement.

The augmented reality game, which allows people to catch Pokémon in the real world, was the mostpopular app on iTunes when it debuted in July.Since then, it has declined in popularity, as users were likely tired of stumbling upon Zubats and Rattatas.

Starbucks has also been rumored to be working on a similar partnership with Pokémon. They may even be releasing aPokémon-themed drink.

These are just the latest efforts for Niantic to keep people playing its hit game. The app had Halloween and Thanksgiving-themed promotions and theyrecently unveiled a new character, Ditto.
