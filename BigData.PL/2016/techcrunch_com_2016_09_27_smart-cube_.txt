Arrow picks the Smart Cube smartlock as an Indiegogo partner product

A few months back Indiegogo and component provider Arrowannounced a deal aimed at helping bring promising crowdfunding projects to market, providing hopeful campaigns with some much-needed tools in those difficult months following funding.

Smart Armor will get that push for this morning’slaunch of the Smart Cube, a smartlock system that can be adapted to a number of different settings, including cabinets, drawers and the like. The mechanism utilizes Bluetooth low-energy and can be set to auto unlock when a connected smart device is nearby.

The device’s official crowdfunding campaign kicks off this morning, with Smart Cube units available for a $49 pledge. Through the program, Arrow will offer up engineers, prototyping services, supply chain expertise and other help navigating a number of the pain points standing between a successful campaign and eventual product release.

The project’s success should prove an interesting insight into the Indiegogo/Arrow partnership, as well as a barometer as to whether external inputs from a manufacturing partner can help crowdfunding hardware campaigns feel like a little less of a crapshoot.
