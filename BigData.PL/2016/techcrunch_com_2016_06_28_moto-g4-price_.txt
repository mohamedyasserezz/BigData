The Moto G4 is arriving in the US July 12th, priced at $199

Looks like it won’t be too much longer until U.S. users can get their grubby paws on Motorola’s forthcomingfourth-gen Moto G. Announced last month right around Google I/O, the baseline G4 will be arriving on Amazon, Best Buy (which will be offering up a $50 gift card with the purchase) and Walmart.com, and various other stateside retailers (including Motorola’s own site) on July 12.

The universally unlocked handset features a 5.5-inch 1080p display, 1.5GHz octa-core Snapdragon processor and a quick-charging battery, all for a starting price of $199. An additional $50 will get users the base-level G4 Plus that same day, featuring many of the same specs, along with a souped up 16-megapixel rear-facing camera and a fingerprint reader.

Motorola announced therelease details in a blog postcomplete with a handy infographic about how most of us apparently still have no idea what an unlocked phone is. No mention yet of how the budget-minded G4 Play fits in.
