Captain Train rebrands to become Trainline following acquisition

Earlier this year, TrainlineacquiredCaptain Train for quite a bit of money. Now, Trainline is trying to unify its train ticket booking system. First, Captain Train is now called Trainline, just like its parent company.

The logo, the app and the website are now all called Trainline. If you go onthetrainline.com, you can book tickets for the U.K. Ontrainline.eu, you can get tickets for Europe. Behind the scene, Captain Train runs trainline.eu.

Other than that, everything still feels familiar. The website and apps work exactly the same way. But it’s still a bit confusing that there are now two different Trainline services available.

Eventually, both services plan to merge and offer a single platform to book train tickets for Europe and the U.K. Given that Captain Train had its own itinerary calculation system, it seems likely that Captain Train’s technology is going to run all of Trainline’s services in the future.

And yet, I’m a bit sad to see the Captain Train brand go away. As long as the service remains rock solid, everything is fine. But many users don’t like change. So let’s hope Trainline is only going to improve with Captain Train’s integration.
