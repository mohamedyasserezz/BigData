Minecraft comes to Apple TV

Minecraft, having already come to just about every other platform, is now on Apple TV, or will be soon at any rate. Well, that’s pretty much the news!

Tim Cook announced it at the Apple live event today, after mentioning the thousands of apps and games already available for the platform. This isn’t Pocket Edition, as I originally thought (and wrote) but a new version called Minecraft: Apple TV Edition. Same code base as the others, and it should be similar, though timing for new features will likely differ from the other versions.

It shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise — Microsoft has been big on interoperability and ubiquity lately, and Minecraft is a great ambassador. It’s pretty much this generation’s “Doom,” in that it’ll be ported to every single platform it can be, evenhilariously impractical ones.
