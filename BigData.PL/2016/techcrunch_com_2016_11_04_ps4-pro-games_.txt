Sony shares a list of 39 titles that will be optimized for the PS4 Pro at launch

Next Thursday is PS4 Pro day. Announced two months ago at anevent in New York, the souped up version of Sony’s console has been designed with 4K and high dynamic range gaming in mind, featuring amped up specs, including an eight-core x86-64 AMD Jaguar CPU, a GPU offering double the power of the earlier PS7 and a 1TB hard drive.

Until now, however, Sony hasn’t offered up a list of games that will optimized for all of that newfound firepower. The first batch of games is just shy of 40. It’s a combination of newer titles like Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare that will ship with the functionality built-in and older ones that will be getting updates designed to take advantage of the Pro.

The company is clearly rushing to get studios to optimize games for the new hardware, adding that an additional 45 games will be added to the list by year’s end, including Watch Dogs 2, Killing Floor 2, The Last Guardian, and Final Fantasy XV. Nioh, Resident Evil 7 biohazard, meanwhile, will be getting the treatment early next year. All of Sony’s own titles will be on-board for 2017, as well.
