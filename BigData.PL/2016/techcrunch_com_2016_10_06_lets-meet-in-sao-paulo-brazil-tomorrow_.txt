Lets meet in São Paulo, Brazil tomorrow

Hello, São Paulo. I’ve spoken with some folks and we’ll be meeting atCubotomorrow at 7pm until 10pm. There will be free booze and some finger food and I’d love to see you there.

This is basically a micro-meetup – an opportunity to talk about your startup and network. No agenda, no speeches, and no onstage pitching. I’ll be there and I’m ready to hear what you’re doing so get your 2 minute elevator pitch ready. It will be a lot of fun.

PleaseRSVP hereand I’ll see you at Cubo, Rua Casa do Ator, 919 at 7pm.
