Here’s the full schedule of NBA games that will be shown in VR this season

Last week theNBA announced they would be partnering with NextVR to stream one game a weekin VR all season long.

Today theyconfirmedan exact list of matchups and dates, and the good news is that each team will appear at least once throughout the season.

This doesn’t mean it’s exactly equal — the Warriors will play four times in VR, while the Sixers appear only once.

The matchups will take place every Tuesday night (with the exception of one game later in the season).

This is a nice touch by the NBA to make it really easy to try to follow along in VR — every Tuesday you know a game will be on NextVR, and all you need to do is confirm the time and teams. Speaking of time, the league also did a good job varying games between time zones so no one has to stay up super late or leave work early to watch every week.

The league also announced that highlights, condensed games and full game recaps will be available in VR on NextVR after the game. As a reminder, you need to be an NBA League Pass subscriber to stream these games each week, and you’ll do so within NextVR’s app for Gear VR, not within the League Pass app. NextVR also says that other VR headsets will be supported later this season.
