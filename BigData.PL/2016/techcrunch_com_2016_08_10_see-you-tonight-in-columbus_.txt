See you tonight in Columbus

I’ll be in Columbus, Ohio, on Wednesday, August 10, to hold a night of pitches and open mic shenanigans so bring your guitar and pitching shoes. The event will be at O’Toole’s 4796 W Broad St, right off I-270.

We’ll start at 7 p.m. sharp with pitches, so get there after work. And at 8pm or so we’ll have an open stage with live music – I’m going to play with my friend Rick so bring your phones – and networking.

I’ve picked eight startups already and they’re ready to go. Three judges will join us from the community.

Special thanks to the folks atKinsta,Rev1Ventures, andBylined.mefor sponsoring the night!
