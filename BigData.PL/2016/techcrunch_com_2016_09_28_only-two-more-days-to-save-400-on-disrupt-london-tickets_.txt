Only two more days to save £400 on Disrupt London tickets

We’ve given you an extra week, but your time to save £400 on Disrupt London tickets is ending soon. You have until this Friday, September 30 to secure extra early-bird tickets to Disrupt London 2016 for just £800 each, or £700 each when you buy more than one.

You can get those ticketshere.

That ticket is your all-access pass to everything that makes Disrupt awesome. You’ll get to attend a series of interviews and fireside chats with some of the best entrepreneurs and investors around, and chat with representatives from dozens of promising early-stage startups in Startup Alley and Hardware Alley.

And if that isn’t enough to convince you to sign up, you’ll also get to check out theillustrious Startup Battlefield competition, in which a few dozen companies pitch our panel of judges with the hopes of winning the coveted Disrupt Cup, a £30,000 main prize, and, perhaps most importantly, the attention of the press and tech community at large.

If you’re somehow still on the fence, you’ll also get to attend all of the parties and after-parties that will let you keep the good times going long after the show floor closes up for the night.

Of course, to do any of it, you will need a ticket, and the best way to get a ticket is to purchase an extra early-bird ticket and keep an extra £400 in your pocket. Extra early-bird ticket sales end Friday, September 30, so get to ourticketing pageto get your tickets before prices increase on Saturday.

Disrupt London 2016 takes place December 5-6 at London’s beautiful Copper Box Arena, and we can’t wait to see you all there.
