Uber launches gift cards in 35K retail locations across the US

Uber is adding its own gift cards to the list of ways you can pay for the service. The ride-hailing startup has debuted physical cards that will go on sale in 35,000 retail locations across the U.S. over the next few weeks, including stores like Walmart, Target and CVS.

The company will also be selling them directly fromUber.com, and the gift cards can be redeemed in the Uber mobile app. They donâ€™t expire, just like cash, and they come in $25 and $50 versions, as we all as a self-set value amount that you can specify between $15 and $500. The balance carries over across rides until the total amount is expended.

Uber cards are valid in the U.S. only, and cost exactly the face value of the gift card itself, with no additional fees. The company is also preparing a business-focused card-purchasing program for providing employees with Uber credit as an additional employment benefit; details on how that will work are forthcoming.

Lyft also debuted a physical gift card program earlier this year, selling $20 value cards exclusively via partner Starbucks in some of their U.S. locations.
