This portable 200W “laser bazooka” is terrifying and unnecessary — and I want one

Have you ever played with a laser pointer? Those usually cap out at around 0.005 watts.

This guy built a “laser bazooka” that, at 200 watts, comes in at about 40,000 times stronger than that.

While YouTuber styropyro built his bazooka out of materials torn from a bunch of broken DLP projectors and “a stack of lithium batteries,” this… isn’t something you should build at home. It’s fully capable of starting fires if you point it at the wrong thing, and would permanently wreck unprotected eyes (note his MASSIVE WELDING MASK) in no time flat.

Says Styro, “… it feels like I’m holding a bolt of lightning in my hand.”

(If you’re just looking for the footage of him pointing it at stuff… that starts at the 2:00 mark. If you’re looking for the footage of some giant moths he’s hatched just chillin’, that starts at 3:20in this video. Why? Because he has a 200W laser cannon… what are you gonna do about it?)

Don’t want to burn your house down, butdowant to see more DIY laser insanity? Styropyro has a ton of iton his YouTube channel—his laser sword is particularly excellent.
