Twitter for iOS gets ‘night mode’ support

Twitter is rolling out night mode to users of its official iOS app, the company announced today. Night mode turns Twitter’s dark-text-on-light-background interface upside down, giving a darker look that should be easier to read at night or in dimmer indoor environments.

The night mode feature first came to Twitter’s official Android app starting in July. On iOS, it’s accessible via the gear icon that provides access to the app’s setting menu on your user profile, giving you the ability to switch it on and off with a tap.
