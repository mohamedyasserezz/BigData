CrunchMatch registrations are now open for investors and startups

At this year’s TechCrunch Disrupt NY 2016, TechCrunch introduced a new networking tool called CrunchMatch that helped 19 investors and 65 startups make a total of 88 connection meetings at Disrupt. AtDisrupt SF 2016, TechCrunch is looking to take those connections to a whole new level. And to do that, we need all you investors and startup founders out there to get involved.

TechCrunch is happy to announce that the registration process for CrunchMatch is now open, and signing up couldn’t be simpler. When an investor registers for Disrupt, they’ll receive an invitation to fill out a questionnaire about their investment interests. Startups who purchase Startup Alley ticket packages will receive a similar form.

TechCrunch will use the responses to match investors with startups that fit their investment profile and interest areas. We’ll also help coordinate those meetings at a private space and at a time that works for both parties during the course of the Disrupt conference.

CrunchMatch participants at Disrupt NY raved about the experience, with 85% of participating investors using CrunchMatch to scout future investments, and 93% of investors saying they would participate in CrunchMatch again. Sixty percent of investors found the CrunchMatch meetings effective, relevant and productive, and 83% indicated they had follow-up meetings with investors.

The CrunchMatch program is free for Disrupt attendees, so we hope all you investors and startups out there will sign up to make promising contacts that could lead to your next major round of funding, or bring the next great startup into your investment portfolio.

To participate, you’ll need to get your hands on tickets to Disrupt, and you can do that overon our ticketing page. If you have additional questions, send us an email atstartupalley@beta.techcrunch.com.
