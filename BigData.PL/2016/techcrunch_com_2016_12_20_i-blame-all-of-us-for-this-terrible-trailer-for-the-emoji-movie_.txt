I blame all of us for this terrible trailer for The Emoji Movie

Listen, it’s not only your fault that The Emoji Movie is a thing that exists; but you’re at least partly to blame. And so am I. We all have to deal with the fact that this movie got greenlit because of what we’ve done.

Your first act of penance is to watch the above. Then, watch it again – that’s no less than we deserve.
