Customers are still waiting for their folding DJI drone

As GoPro took to the stage in Squaw Valley to show off its long-awaited Karma Drone, DJI’s PR rep smirkingly tweeted, “I’m watching a competitor unveil a new product. I ain’t worried about a thing.”

Within a matter of weeks, the company was showing off its own answer to the foldable drone — a smaller and more feature-packed offering that indeed afforded the opportunity to gloat. DJI’s fanbase — and the drone community in general — was whole-heartedly impressed.

But now, a full five days afterthe Mavic Prowas set to start shipping (and three days before the Karma is set to take flight), early adopters are getting antsy waiting for the drone to arrive. Some early reviewers have gotten their hands on a unit, but customers who have already plunked down a substantial deposit at a number of retailers haven’t heard a peep.

DJI attempted to cut this one off at the pass a few days back witha statementfrom the company’s Global Director of Communications.

Since unveiling the Mavic Pro, we’ve had amazingly strong global demand. Production is in full swing, and we will be fulfilling orders as fast as we can.

Not a heck of a lot in the way of details in that letter, though the culprit seems to be manufacturing delays as the company attempts to meet demand. Two days after that initial posting, delays seem to still be widespread. We’ve reached out to DJI and will update when we hear something official.
