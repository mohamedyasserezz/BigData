Dyson adds a heater to its combo bladeless fan/air purifier

Dyson’s been on something of a product launching roll, of late – hair dryers, robotic vacuums, it’s a diverse portfolio to put it mildly. The latest launch from the company, however, isn’t so much new territory as it is fusing together of a few of its existing lines into a single device.

As its name implies, there’s a lot going on with thePure Hot+Cool Link. The $600 tower is essentially a deluxe version of Dyson’s Pure Cool Link, the combo bladeless fan/air purifier that debuted earlier this year. It still promises to remove 99.97-percent of allergens and pollutants from the air via a HEPA filter, while auto cooling a room via the Dyson Link app.

A heater has been added to the device, which can be controlled via app or remote, warming up until it reaches its target temperature. The new device starts hitting U.S. retailers on September 18, priced at $100 above the larger Pure Cool Link tower.
