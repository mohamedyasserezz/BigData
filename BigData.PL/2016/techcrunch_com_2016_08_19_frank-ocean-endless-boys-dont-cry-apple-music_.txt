Frank Ocean dropsEndlessvisual album on Apple Music

It’s finally here.

After four years without a new album and a few weeks ofcryptic teasing, Frank Ocean has finally released… well,something.

In the same vein as Beyonce’sLemonade, Ocean released a visual album called Endless exclusively on Apple Music.

It’s about 45 minutes long, and is an interesting (and long-awaited) prequel to the Boys Don’t Cry album. Apple confirmed to Rolling Stone that the Boys Don’t Cry album will launch this weekend.

Endlessconnects a few previously mysterious dots. On August 1, Ocean held a live stream in an empty warehouse, the same (and only) location where the visual album is shot. During the live stream, Ocean offered little by the way of actual songs, and instead served up cryptic threads of audio, both electronic and acoustic.

Endless, which shows multiple Frank Oceans in the process of building a staircase, seems to bridge the gap between the confusing live stream and this weekend’s full album release.

The whole thing is on Apple Music, which costs $10/month for a single user and still comes with a three-month free trial.
