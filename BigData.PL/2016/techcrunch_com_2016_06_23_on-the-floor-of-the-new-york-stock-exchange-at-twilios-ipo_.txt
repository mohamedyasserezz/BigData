On the floor of The New York Stock Exchange at Twilio’s IPO

Today Twilio braved the public markets and did what no technology startup has done all year – go public. The company began trading this morning on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol TWLO, and didn’t disappoint.

After pricing at $15 dollars, the stock opened at $23.99 per share and closed at $28.79 — a resounding vote of confidence from a public market still disappointed with the tepid performance of last year’s tech IPOs.

To celebrate the offering, Twilio held a “code jam” (a NYSE-safe version of a Hackathon) with three developers on the trading floor.

We got to talk to one of Twilio’s developer evangelists participating in the Code Jam to see what he was building, as well as NYSE President Tom Farley to hear about what the exchange thinks of the current state of the tech IPO market.
