Forget Spectacles, group messaging is Snapchatâ€™s most important launch in 2016

There was neither fanfare nor pizzazz, but yesterday Snap â€”the company formerly known as Snapchatâ€” quietly shippedÂ a new feature thatÂ could dent other messagingÂ apps and obstruct upcoming social startups.

The feature was group messaging for up to 16 people.Â Itâ€™s anÂ obvious part of any chatÂ app but something thatÂ hadnâ€™t been present in Snapchat until this week.

A messaging app introducing groups isÂ not revolutionary in itself, but when that app happens to have more than 100 million daily users, it becomes a killer feature that impacts other services. Given that Snapchatâ€™s core userbase is young people, thereâ€™s no doubt that they were going elsewhere to host groupÂ conversations with friends. Perhaps it was Kik, orÂ Facebook Messenger, or WhatsApp, or even just iMessage â€” regardless, their user behavior will now change.

Over time, those conversations will migrateÂ over to Snapchat, solidifying engagementÂ with the many millions of teens and people in their 20s for whom itÂ is already theÂ go-to app on their phone. It will also giveÂ less active users a bigÂ reason to open the app more often if their friends drag them into groups.Â Snapchat, as we know, is anchored in messaging but it has built out a considerable media businessÂ and isgoing full-steam on advertising revenue, both of which will be boosted by the introduction of groups.

For an idea of how important this release is, check outthe many, many tweets from excitedÂ users:

This could be just the start of Snapchatâ€™s efforts on multi-person conversation.

TheÂ appÂ offers live video chatting in one-on-one conversations, but that could be extended to cover groups, too, thereby tapping the growing trend for multi-personÂ video communication that servicesÂ likeChatrouletteandHousepartyare pursuing with signs of success. In the case of Houseparty, which was created by the team behind now-defunct streaming appÂ Meerkat,one million people spend at least 20 minutes per dayon its group video chats.

People may best remember SnapÂ in 2016 forSpectacles,its glasses with a built-in camera,Â but the addition of groups seems significantly more impactful. It is particularly important sinceInstagramâ€™s cloning effort is showing signs of successandSnap is reportedly preparing to go publicÂ in 2017.
