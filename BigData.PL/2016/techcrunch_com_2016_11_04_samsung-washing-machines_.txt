Samsung recalls washing machines over injury reports from malfunctioning units

Just when Samsung looked ready to put the last few months behind it to focus on its next step, there’s more bad news from the malfunctioning products department.

To address the issue, the company will either pay for an in-home repair of the machine or offer a rebate on a new washer. Users can check to see if their own units are affectedover at Samsung’s site.
