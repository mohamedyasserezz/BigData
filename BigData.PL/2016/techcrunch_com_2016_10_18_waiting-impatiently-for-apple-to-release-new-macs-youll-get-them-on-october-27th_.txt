Waiting impatiently for Apple to release new Macs? You’ll get them on October 27th

So I’ve been hearing for weeks now that Apple has been waffling a bit on a date for its late-October Mac event. But, according to my sources, a date has been picked: Thursday, October 27th. So those looking for a new MacBook, hold your horses. And if you’re a journo, flights are getting iffy but hotels are pretty cheap still.

I reached out to Apple for a comment on their secret, unannounced event but shockingly they did not reply.

Apple typically holds its events on a Tuesday or Wednesday. But itmoved its earnings call earlier this monthto Tuesday the 25th, so that was out. And theMicrosoft Surface All-in-One PC event, which takes place on October 26th, knocks Wednesday out. It almost didn’t rule it out, I think, but that would have looked pretty silly on Apple’s part. Better they go the day after.

The event should hold news for those looking for new Mac models. A bunch of stuff has been previously rumored and reported and the stuff that seems the most accurate is new 13″MacBook Air models with USB-C portsand a new MacBook Pro with afancy digital display above the keyboardand Skylake Intel processors. New iMacs could appear, as well as a standalone 5k monitor to replace the Thunderbolt display. That devicecould have an internal GPUthat enables MacBooks or older Macs to drive the much higher-resolution display.

Apple’s Macs, save the MacBook, have not been updated for over a year.
