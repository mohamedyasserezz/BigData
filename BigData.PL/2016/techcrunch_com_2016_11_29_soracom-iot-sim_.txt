The company’s slightly byzantinepricing plansare optimized for a number of low-bandwidth, high uptime applications. The company’s SIM cards cost $5 each plus $1.8 per month (well, $0.06 per day, to be exact) and can be ordered in quantities ranging from one to 1,000. After that, the company offersa number of plansaimed at IoT applications.

The SIMs are aimed at global use, with pricing tiers ranging from $0.08 to $2.0 per megabyte depending on region. Much of the U.S., China and Europe fall into the cheapest tier.

The company’s products at launch include Soracom Air (aimed at startup & enterprise IoT), Soracom Beam (which reduces power consumption of IoT devices by offloading processing to cloud services) and Soracom Canal (VPN services for secure comms between connected devices and AWS private cloud services).
