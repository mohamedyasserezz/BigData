There’s an Amazon Dash button for Cheez-It crackers now

Never forget that you’re living in the future. A time when it’s no longer necessary to leave the house in order to refresh your supply of cheesy, salty snack food. Heck, you don’t even have to log onto Amazon. As of today, ordering a box of Cheez-It crackers is as simple as hitting a small, plastic button.

The Sunshine Cracker is one of 60 new buttons Amazon has added toits Dash portfolio, which currently consists of more than 200 brands, all told. The new slate includes a pretty broad range of snacks, pet food and PoopBags. Other notables rolled out today include Folgers, Meow Mix, Milk Bone, PopTarts, Powerade and Purell hand wipes. Amazon is also offering some of its own products, including Basics Batteries and Gift Cards.

If that’s not a broad selection, I don’t know what is.

Amazon also used the announcement to issue a few metrics around the Dash program, including the fact that orders are up five times over the same time period last year. And now with PoopBags in the mix, the sky is clearly the limit. Here’sa list of all the new buttons.
