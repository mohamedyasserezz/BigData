DJI Mavic Pro: 0, Birdhouse: 1

Our DJI Mavic Pro review will be delayed a bit. Stay tuned.

First thoughts, though: This thing is a lot of fun. The Mavic Pro is fast and agile and as an extreme range. This one didn’t survive an encounter with a birdhouse. Which is fine anyway. Birds are gross.

The props attach by a spring loading mechanism. Push down and twist to remove them from the prop arms. The drone survived the crash and I should be able to get it flying again with a new set of props, which DJI is working on getting to me.

Expect our review next week. Hopefully.
