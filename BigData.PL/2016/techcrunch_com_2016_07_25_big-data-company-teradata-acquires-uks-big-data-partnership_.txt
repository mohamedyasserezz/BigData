Big data company Teradata acquires UK’s Big Data Partnership

More consolidation in the so-called big data space. Publicly-listed U.S. big data company Teradata hasacquiredLondon-based Big Data Partnership, a startup that provides big data solutions and training to help companies become more savvy in the use of, well,big data. You may have noticed a recurring theme here.

In what is likely to have been a modest deal, terms of the acquisition, including price, remain undisclosed. Big Data Partnership has raised just over £4 million in funding, backed primarily by U.K. and U.S.-based VC Beringea.

What we do know is that Big Data Partnership will now join Teradata’s Think Big consulting practice to enable it to expand its open source consulting services internationally. Initially this will focus on the U.K., France, Germany, Nordics, Switzerland and China.

Citing “deep expertise” in disruptive technologies, specifically name-checking Apache Hadoop, Big Data Partnership is said to compromise a team of big data architects, engineers, data scientists and certified trainers who work with clients on-site and at the startup’s London, “Tech City”-based offices.

The bigger picture here is that Big Data Partnership and Teradata’s Think Big consulting offering is addressing demand for better data science within companies with data sets that are growing exponentially.

“We continue to strengthen our world-class solutions business to help our customers design, build and run analytics, and the Big Data Partnership consultancy fits well with Teradata’s increasingly strong global analytics practice,” said Rick Farnell, senior vice president, Think Big, in a statement. “As a result, we see fast-growing opportunities in the services market, where hybrid platforms and integration of on-premises and cloud capabilities evolve seamlessly.”
