Twitter will livestream weekly games from MLB and the NHL

Twitter is expanding its live sports plans, with weekly, live streamed games from Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League.

The live streams will be available for free to out-of-market viewers, whether they’re logged into Twitter or not. Twitter is also announcing a new nightly sports highlights show called The Rally, produced by mobile video company120 Sports. (The Rally and NHL games will be available in the United States; MLB games will be available worldwide, with exceptions for select international territories.)

Twitter says it will be selling ads to go with this programming, which is enabled by a new partnership between Twitter and MLB Advanced Media.

“Twitter has long been a great partner and platform for both baseball and hockey fans as they follow their favorite teams and players every day,” said Kenny Gersh, MLBAM’s executive vice president of business, in the partnership release. “We know fans will embrace what this wide-ranging partnership brings – expanded and reliable access to live baseball and hockey and the introduction of Twitter’s first daily live highlight show delivered intuitively to a platform where they’re actively engaged with the games.”

Earlier this year,Twitter announced a deal with the NFLto stream Thursday Night Football, and it gave users their first peek at its live sports experienceby streaming Wimbledon.
