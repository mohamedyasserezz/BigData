These self-driving cars seen in downtown SF seem to be the same as those used in Uber’s self-driving pilot program in Pittsburgh. Uberrecently deployeda fleet of 14 Ford Fusions equipped with radar, cameras and other sensing equipment developed by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University’srobotics center.

Pittsburgh Uber users are now able to opt in to hailing one of these 14 autonomous vehicles in town. But an Uber spokesperson tells TechCrunch that’s not the case with the self-driving cars spotting in SF.

“A handful of cars equipped with advanced driver safety and self-driving technology are now being tested in the Bay Area. These are for internal research use only. They will have a test driver upfront and will not be part of our ridesharing service. Testing in different environments is critical to the future success of this technology, which will help dramatically improve road safety,” Uber said.

So how long until riders here can choose to try out one of Uber’s self-driving cars? Uber said it didn’t have a timeline but did add it would keep us posted. We’ll be sure to let you know as soon as we hear more.
