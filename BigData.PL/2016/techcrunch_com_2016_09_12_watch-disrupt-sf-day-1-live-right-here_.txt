Disrupt is a place where dreams come true.

Over the course of a year or two, folks can go from sitting in the audience or hosting a booth in the Startup Alley to launching a new company on the Battlefield stage. Or better, to being invited to speak as one of our esteemed guests.

Speaking of, we have anincredible lineupin store for you today, including chats with Facebook’s David Marcus, Megan Smith and Amac of the U.S. Government, and HBO’s Mike Judge. After that, the Battlefield begins.

Watching the on-stage content is not only informative, but emotional. And we want you to be a part of it, even if you can’t make it out to Pier 48 here in San Francisco.

This year, you might actually have a little trouble escaping us, because we’re streaming the conferenceeverywhere.

You can, of course, watch the stream right here. Or you can choose from one of our other many streaming platforms:
