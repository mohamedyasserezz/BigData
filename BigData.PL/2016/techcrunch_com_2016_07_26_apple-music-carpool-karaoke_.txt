Apple Music picks up Carpool Karaoke as a standalone series

So, here’s something I wasn’t expecting: Those Carpool Karaoke segments on James Corden’sLate Late Showare being turned into a standalone show — a show that’s been picked up by Apple Music.

According to anumberofstoriesin the Hollywood press, Apple will be airing 16 episodes, one each week, and they’ll be available worldwide through its subscription music service. Neither the premiere date nor the host (it probably won’t be Corden) have been announced.

This doesn’t seem quite as weird when you remember that Apple has been ramping up its investments into original video content, includinga new reality show calledPlanet of the Apps. At the same time, the Lip Sync Battle segments from Jimmy Fallon’sTonight Showhave also been spun out intoa show of their ownon Spike.

AndCarpool Karaokeis definitely Corden’s breakout hit, particularly online. For example, a segment with Michelle Obama (with a surprise guest) already has32 million views on YouTubeafter less than a week.

Update:An Apple spokesperson sent me the announcement, including the following statement from Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services:

We love music, and Carpool Karaoke celebrates it in a fun and unique way that is a hit with audiences of all ages. It’s a perfect fit for Apple Music — bringing subscribers exclusive access to their favorite artists and celebrities who come along for the ride.
