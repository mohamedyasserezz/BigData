The final day of Disrupt is upon us. Which means that I don’t have the energy for enthusiasm.

That said, today’s lineup is absolutely killer.

Alongside some amazing speakers, including Twitch’s Emmett Shear, Facebook’s Adam Mosseri, and Instacart’s Apoorva Mehta, we’re also heading into the Finals of the Battlefield.

Finalists includeBlazingDB, Carbon Health, EverlyWell, Mobalytics, Sqreen, and UnifyID.
