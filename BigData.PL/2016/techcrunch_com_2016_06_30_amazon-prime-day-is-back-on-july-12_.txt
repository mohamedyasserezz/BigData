But the deals themselvesleft many consumers disappointedwith the quality of the products offered. On social networks, many people joked about how Prime Day looked more like an online “garage sale.” Other subscriberscomplainedthat some of the better deals on the site were for Amazon’s own hardware, but the company didn’t have enough stock to meet demand.

This year, the company will offer countdown deals for Prime members from July 5 through July 11. U.S. members will be offered deals especially in the entertainment department.
