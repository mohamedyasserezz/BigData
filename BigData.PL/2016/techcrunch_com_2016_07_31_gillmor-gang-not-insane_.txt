Gillmor Gang: Not Insane

The Gillmor Gang â€” Robert Scoble, Frank Radice, Kevin Marks, and Steve Gillmor. Recorded live Friday, July 29, 2016. In 1972, the Firesign Theatre released a film nominating George Papoon as the National Surrealist Light Peoples Party candidate for president. The campaign rallying cry, Not Insane, has never been more appropriate. Plus, the latest G3 (below) with Kristie Wells, Elisa Camahort Page, Francine Hardaway, and Tina Chase Gillmor.
