Confirmed: Zola wedding registry raises $25 million from Lightspeed Venture Partners

Zola, the online wedding registry for engaged couples, has confirmed that it raised $25 million in Series C funding led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according toRe/code.

Wefirst reportedon the round in late November, at which time sources said the company was valued at $200 million, pre-money.

Zola lets couples put together a wedding registry online, which can include products from brick-and-mortar retailers, services like Blue Apron, or funds for various high-cost items (like, for example, a honeymoon).

The report said that Zola is tracking toward $120 million in annual gross sales for 2017 â€” Zola takes approximately 40 percent for every product purchased through the platform.

Zola CEO Shan-Lyn Ma also told Re/code that some of the new funding from Lightspeed will go toward marketing, including MTA subway ads, which is a growing trend among NYC-based startups (such as Handy, Seamless, Casper, Oscar, and JustWorks).

Including this most recent round of funding, Zola has raised a total of $40.85 million in funding, according toCrunchbase.
