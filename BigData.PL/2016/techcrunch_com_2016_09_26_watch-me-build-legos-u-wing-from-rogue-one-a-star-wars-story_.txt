Lego’s Star Wars series is actually everywhere in my office, so I’m happy new sets from Rogue One: A Star Wars Story are set to launch on September 30. I got the chance to check out one of those sets ahead of launch, and built the U-Wing, a ship new to the Star Wars universe featured in the film.

The U-Wing’s official designation is the UT-60D, and it’s made by fictional Star Wars shipmaker Incom, which not coincidentally also makes the X-Wing. It has a four-engine design similar to the iconic X-Wing, and its wings fold out from the body as you can see in the images below.

Unlike the X-Wing, the U-Wing is actually a troop transport, capable of carrying rebels in its belly. The Lego model features sliding doors on either side of that troop bay, which pull back to reveal laser mounts to support landings on hostile planets.

The new U-Wing will retail for $79.99 when it’s released in a few days. Lego has anumber of kits launching alongside it, too, in anticipation of Rogue One’s release December 16. There’s also a new instalment of the ongoing Lego Star Wars stop-motion animation tie-in for the movie, which you can check out below.
