Take your work setup on the road

Editor’s note:This post was done in partnership withWirecutter, a buyer’s guide to the best technology. This is a condensed version of several Wirecutter guides; you can find links to the full guides in the discussions below.

You’ve got agreat workspace set upandthe best gear for getting things done, so why do you feel your favorite coffee shop calling to you? Because you’re craving a chance to drop the stress of your usual desk, your computer, and the people around you. Because you’ve created a habit of blaming your environment for distracting you. Becauseyour brain needs novelty.

So take your brain out of its comfortable laziness and bring it somewhere new with this gear, researched and tested byWirecutterand selected here for tossing in a bag and bringing wherever it is you find new, novel, and productive.

First things first: a place to stash your go-anywhere office.

Wirecutter staffers tested a lot of laptop bag models to fit different gear, style, and travel styles, and have13 recommendations. But for most roving laptop warriors, theIncase Icon Packhits the junction point of good looks, carrying capacity, and comfort. If you need something a bit smaller, we also like theSTM Prime 13-inch laptop backpack.

If it’s time to upgrade, or work is letting you pick out your next model, the good news/bad news is: You’ve got a lot of good choices available. If you pack up and haul around your laptop a lot, your best bet is probably a13-inch MacBook Airor ourfavorite Windows ultrabook, theDell XPS 13.

The bestbudget Windows laptop we’ve seenistheAcer Aspire E5-574G(we hope it’s still available when you read this). And if you’re not sure if you might do better with a power notebook, a gaming-capable model, a sturdy business book, a hybrid, or a Chromebook, allow us to answer: SeeWhich laptop should I buy?(also available inflowchart form).

If your laptop doesn’t fit snugly in your bag, or takes a lot of knocks on your out-of-office jaunts, add a layer of peace of mind. A lot of styles, materials, and extra pocket options are covered inour guide to sleeves and cases.

Tablets can get some work done. Most people should get aniPad Air 2and add on anApple Smart Case; buy anAndroid tabletonly if you are deeply invested in specific Android apps. With the recent innovation of second-screen apps likeDuet(iPad) andSplashtop(Android), you can have a kind of multimonitor experience wherever you have the room to set up.

USB battery packs may seem interchangeable, but after we researched 160 models, bought 50 pounds of batteries, then tested 17 packs in a dedicated battery laboratory, we found thatthe best onescharge more devices, more often, in the most convenient sizes and shapes.

For your office-in-a-bag convenience, we like theAmazonBasics Portable Power Bank 16,100 mAh, which can quickly charge most smartphones up to five times and handle tablets, too.

Is it too much to hope that you might find headphones that have a fully iPhone-compatible mic, volume control, remote buttons; feel and sound good; stand up to abuse; and come in at under $25? It is not—but you only find them bytesting 108 pairsand consulting with a panel of audio experts.

The Brainwavz Delta with Mic, available foriPhonesorAndroid, are the best headphones for ensuring you can take that conference call or Web meeting, and still provide wonderful tunes to your ears.

Wi-Fi hotspot

Solid Wi-Fi is not a given once you leave your desk cocoon. If you work remotely often enough, you should invest in a reliable cellular-to-Wi-Fi hotspot.

TheVerizon Jetpack 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot AC791Lhas the best battery life on the most reliable network, and it can even charge your phone. If you’re on AT&T’s Mobile Share plan, theAT&T Unite Prois a remarkably similar model from the same maker.

Travel surge protector

If you want to win friends and influence people at the coffee shop, pack anAccell Home or Away surge protectorand turn that one last wall plug into two surge-protected outlets. It doesn’t take up much space, it’s lighter than you think, and it makes you feel perfectly prepared.

Lap desk

Some days, and some jobs, just don’t allow for a lot of wandering around your town, or even your neighborhood.

But working in a different room can still provide a moment’s respite from your all-too-familiar desk. We tried out six of the top models in a very crowded, look-alike field, and found theLapGear XL Executive LapDeskto be surprisingly better than the competition for at-home wanderlust. It sits comfortably on your legs, its handle makes carrying it easier than most models, and your legs won’t get as hot as they would with simple slabs of plastic.

The Wirecutter staff is just as picky about its Web apps and software as they are about, say,pensorpencils. After years of figuring out what works for roughly 50 people working all around North America (including Hawaii), we’ve come to appreciate the11 apps we use to get our jobs done.

They are not perfect—no software is—but they work for us, and they will likely make it easier for you to report in from a buzzing coffee shop, a quiet bar, or the perfectly shaded steps outside your favorite museum.
