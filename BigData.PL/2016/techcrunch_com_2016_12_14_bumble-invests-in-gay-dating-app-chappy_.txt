Bumble invests in gay dating app Chappy

Bumble, the dating app that puts women in the driver’s seat, has today announced that it is leading a seed round investment in gay dating app Chappy.

The company is not disclosing the details of the investment, but they did say that Bumble is the sole investor in the round and will take an equity stake. In exchange, Bumble will be offering product development and marketing support.

Chappyis a gay dating app based in the UK. The app lets users choose what they’re looking for and when, offering a sliding scale within the app that ranges from “Mr. Right” to “Mr. Right Now,” as well as a “Mr. Who Knows” setting.

Anyone who is looking for Mr. Right will only be matched with others looking for Mr. Right, and the same is true for those marked as Mr. Right Now. The “Mr. Who Knows” group of users will be matched with both groups and assess the situation from there.

While Bumble is already optimized for the LGBTQ community, the brand has always centered around ensuring that women feel safe and empowered to make the first move. This doesn’t necessarily mean that gay men can’t find suitors on Bumble itself, but the brand doesn’t necessarily speak to that particular demographic.

“Bumble is passionate about helping people connect confidently, safely and in an environment where they feel empowered,” said a Bumble spokesperson. “Chappy shares this same values and has created a product for an audience that week feel is very underserved. Bumble has made great strides for women in the dating space and we believe Chappy will do the same for gay men.”

With an investment in Chappy, Bumble can continue to cultivate its relationship with the gay male demographic without taking any focus away from the core mission, which is to empower women.
