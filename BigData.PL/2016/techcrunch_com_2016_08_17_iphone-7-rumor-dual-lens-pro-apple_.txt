Dual-lens in, Pro out in latest iPhone 7 rumor

At the height of iPhone rumor season, Japanese siteMac Otokara(which has a relatively good track record with rumors like this) reports that there will only be two iPhones unveiled this fall, the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus.

Mac Otokara claims that reliable sources confirmed these names.

Throughout the summer,rumors have swirledthat Apple would unveil three new iPhones: a standard iPhone 7, an iPhone 7 Plus, and a dual-lens-equipped iPhone 7 Pro.

However, this latest report states that what we thought was the iPhone 7 Plus, with the same single-lens camera enclosure on the current-generation iPhones, is actually a fall-back in case the dual-lens technology didn’t work out.

But according to this latest report, Apple has the dual-lens system under control, and that it will come as a part of the iPhone 7 Plus.

Of course, if Apple unveils adual-lens iPhone 7 Plus, it could dramatically improve the iPhone, bringing multi-aperture cameras to the hardware and ultimately improving image quality and low-light performance. Which would be a much greater improvement (and reason to upgrade) than Live Photos.

Of course, this is just as much of a rumor as anything else that’s been said about the unannounced next-gen iPhones, so take everything with a grain of salt.
