Hacker takes over Oculus CEO’s Twitter account, announces new CEO

Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe had his Twitter account hacked Wednesday; the hacker took the opportunity to promptly announce a new CEO for the virtual reality company.

Update: the account appears to be back under Brendan’s control.

This is just the latest in a string of tech CEO’s having their Twitter accounts compromised, this attack does not appear to be from the same hacker group responsible for the hacks on the accounts of Travis Kalanick, Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg and Dick Costolo.

Late Wednesday night, Iribe’s Twitter bio temporarily read, “hey its @Lid… im not testing ya security im just havin a laugh.”

The hacker told me in a Twitter DM that he accessed the password vialast month’s MySpace breach, he also said that he also would’ve managed to access Iribe’s email account had he not had two-factor authentication enabled.

This hacker also does not appear to be a fan of this particular publication.
