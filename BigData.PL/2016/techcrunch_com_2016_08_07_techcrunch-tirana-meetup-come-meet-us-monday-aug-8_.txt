TechCrunch Tirana Meetup — Come meet us, Monday Aug 8

After an impromptu meetup in Prizren, Kosovo, where I met with local startups, I’m heading to Tirana, Albania where I’ll be holding an informal TechCrunch Meetup.Sign up here to get detailssoon on the details. There is also aFacebook event page. It will be on the evening of Monday Aug 8.

I’ve been impressed with the growing tech scene in the Balkans, and it’s clearly one to watch. Founders are now thinking internationally instead of their own regional silos.

I’m also also be scouting for Disrupt entrants forDisrupt London, in London, in December. This is a great opportunity to get in front of a TechCrunch staffer before the event.

This will be an informal meetup where I’ll talk a little bit about TechCrunch and getting the attention of media outside your own country and we can talk startups, entrepreneurship, and funding.

If you would like to sponsor the meetup email mike@beta.techcrunch.com. We just need a venue and some beer, and a projector / beamer.
