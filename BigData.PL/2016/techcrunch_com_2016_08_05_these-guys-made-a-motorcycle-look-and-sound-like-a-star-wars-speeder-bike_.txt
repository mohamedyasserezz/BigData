These guys made a motorcycle look (and sound!) like a Star Wars Speeder Bike

I’ve never been a big motorcycle guy. I have the hand/eye coordination of a sleepy toddler, and I’m pretty sure I’d hurt myself within about two minutes of firing up the engine.

This bike wants me to give it a try anyway.

Built by Wisconsin-based machining/customization shopVintage Works, it’s a custom bike modeled after the mostly-impossible ride of every 80’s kids dreams: the Speeder Bike fromReturn of the Jedi. It’s about as close as you can get to a real Speeder Bike without, you know, defying our current understanding of physics.

Oh, and it doesn’t justlooklike a Speeder — it sounds like one, too. As demonstrated in the video below, they’ve hidden a speaker array within the bike that recreates the winding whirs of a Speeder zipping around Endor.

The bad news: unless you can convince these guys to build a second one for you and have the cash to make it happen, you won’t be able to get one of your own — it’s a one of a kind creation, for now.
