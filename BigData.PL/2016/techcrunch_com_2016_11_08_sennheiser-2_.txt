The Sennheiser x Massdrop HD6XX headphones are probably sold out, but will relaunch

If you were focused on, um,other things this morning, you may well have missed the launch of the HD6XX. The bad news is that the extremely limited editionSennheiser/Massdrop team uplooks to have sold out already. A rep from the company tells TechCrunch, “With the popularity of the drop this morning, we nearly broke the internet.”

Sales on the $200 headphones are currently halted on the site, while it tallies up purchases for what looks to be unprecedented demand and weeds out duplicate requests in the process. We did everyone suddenly go crazy?

For starters, the HD6XX are essentially a limited edition rebrand of Sennheiser’s believed HD 640 cans, updating the popular open back model with a new dark blue color scheme and a few tweaks to the connector.

Then there’s the fact that the first batch of headphones is limited to 5,000. Perhaps most important, however, is the price. The headphones, which have earned a spot as one of the top sub-$1,000 pairs at their $500 price point, have been priced at $200.

The good news is that the headphones will reportedly be back for sale at some undisclosed point, so the rest of us can go back to focusing on whatever else might be happening in the world today.
