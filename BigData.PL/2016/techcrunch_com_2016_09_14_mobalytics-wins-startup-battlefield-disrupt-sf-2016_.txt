And the winner of Startup Battlefield at Disrupt SF 2016 is… Mobalytics

At the very beginning, there were 25 startups. After three days of incredibly fierce competition, we now have a winner.

Startups participating in theStartup Battlefieldhave all been hand-picked to participate in our highly competitive startup competition. They all presented in front of multiple groups of VCs and tech leaders serving as judges for a chance to win $50,000 and the coveted Disrupt Cup.

After hours of deliberations, TechCrunch editors pored over the judges’ notes and narrowed the list down to six finalists:BlazingDB,Carbon Health,EverlyWell,Mobalytics,SqreenandUnifyID.

These startups made their way to the finale to demo in front of our final panel of judges, which included:Cyan Banister(Founders Fund),Roelof Botha(Sequoia Capital),Padmasree Warrior(NextEv),Susan Wojcicki(YouTube) andMatthew Panzarino(TechCrunch).
