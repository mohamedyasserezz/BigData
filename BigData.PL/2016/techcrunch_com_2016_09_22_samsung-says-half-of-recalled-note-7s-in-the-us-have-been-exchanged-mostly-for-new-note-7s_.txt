Samsung says half of recalled Note 7s in the US have been exchanged – mostly for new Note 7s

In case you were wondering when you’ll stop receiving those “please turn off your Samsung Galaxy Note 7” warnings before takeoff, well, we’re halfway there.

Samsung announced today that “about half” of the affected phones — they mean to say, the exploding ones — have been exchanged.

Samsung Electronics America, Inc. announced today that about half of all recalled Galaxy Note7 phones sold in the U.S. have been exchanged through Samsung’s voluntary recall. Additionally, 90 percent of Galaxy Note7 owners have been opting to receive the new Galaxy Note7 since the phones became widely available on Wednesday, September 21.

That last stat must be heartening for Samsung: users are happy to stay with the same phone, as long as it’s cured of any potentially harmful side effects.

Swapping out this many in just a day or so is impressive, but the remaining half million or so may take quite a bit longer to get back. There are plenty of people out there who probably feel they can’t possibly have one of the bad phones, or are blissfully ignorant of this whole saga.

It’s hard to believe, yes, but you can be sure we’re going to hear about Note 7 fires for months to come. That’s just how recalls this big tend to play out.
