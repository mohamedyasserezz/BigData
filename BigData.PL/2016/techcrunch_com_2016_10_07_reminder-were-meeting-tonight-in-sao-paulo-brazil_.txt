Reminder: We’re meeting tonight in São Paulo, Brazil

Can’t wait to see you all tonight in São Paulo. We’ll be meeting atCubotomorrow at 7pm until 10pm. There will be free booze and some finger food and I’d love to see you there.

This is basically a micro-meetup — an opportunity to talk about your startup and network. No agenda, no speeches and no onstage pitching. I’ll be there and I’m ready to hear what you’re doing, so get your two-minute elevator pitch ready. It will be a lot of fun.

PleaseRSVP hereand I’ll see you at Cubo, Rua Casa do Ator, 919 at 7pm.
