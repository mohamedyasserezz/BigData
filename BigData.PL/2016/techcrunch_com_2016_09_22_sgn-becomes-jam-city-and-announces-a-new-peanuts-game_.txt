SGN becomes Jam City and announces a new Peanuts game

Mobile gaming company SGNannouncedtoday that it has a new name,Jam City.

This isn’t the first time the company has rebranded — it was called MindJolt beforeacquiring SGNand thentaking on the namein 2012.

The change may be an inevitable reflection of the company’s — and the industry’s — transition from social to mobile games. CEO Chris DeWolfe (who previously co-founded MySpace) told me that while SGN went through an 18-month rebranding exercise, Jam City was actually the first name that came up as a possibility.

But do players actually care about the name? DeWolfe said, “We’ve asked ourselves the same thing. In a perfect world, we would love to have our consumers identify our games with Jam City, but I don’t think we’re naive … It’s most important to the business community and to our employees.” He added that it helps reinforce Jam City’s “playful-yet-aggressive corporate culture.”

Jam City, which says it has seen revenues grow 100 percent every year for the past five years, is also announcing that it has acquired the rights to create a mobile game based on thePeanutscomics strip by the late Charles Schulz. So it will be creating what DeWolfe described “a casual puzzle game with a very deep storytelling element to it” with beloved characters like Charlie Brown and Snoopy, scheduled for release later this year.
