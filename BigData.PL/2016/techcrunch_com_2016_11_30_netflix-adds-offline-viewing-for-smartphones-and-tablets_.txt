Netflix has added a “download” button for select films and TV shows, and plans to add more to the catalog of available titles in the future. Netflix is understandably starting with its original content, given the simpler licensing arrangements involved, with a launch slate for the feature that includesOrange is The New Black,NarcosandThe Crownavailable for offline playback via download.

A quick survey of the updated app shows a lot of content, both original and first-party, available to view offline. It’ll vary region-to-region, but there should be plenty to get you started for your commute or long-haul flight. You can also select from two different quality options, depending on whether you want to prioritize video quality or device storage space.

The feature is available on Android and iOS smartphones and tablets, provided they’re running iOS 8.0 or Android 4.4.2 or later.
