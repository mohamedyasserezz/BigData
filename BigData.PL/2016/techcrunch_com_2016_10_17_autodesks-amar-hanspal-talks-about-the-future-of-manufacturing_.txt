Autodesk’s Amar Hanspal talks about the future of manufacturing

Imagine a world where manufacturing is no longer geographically mandated, when you can print custom parts in minutes, and anyone can build anything. That’s the worldAmar Hanspal, Autodesk’s SVP or Product, wants to live in.

I talked to Hanspal while he was at a future of manufacturing conference and we talked about all of the pitfalls of future manufacturing, the improvements in design and 3D printing, and what kids will need to know to be ready for the future.
