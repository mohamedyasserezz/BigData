Nike will raffle off its super-limited-edition ‘Back to the Future’ kicks for a good cause

When Nike said it was making the 2016 version of itsBack to the Future-inspired shoeslimited edition, the company wasn’t messing around. Only 89 pairs of the self-lacing shoes will be released to the public (likely not a coincidental nod to the year the futuristic sequel was released),portioned out to eager buyers by way of an online raffle.

As with the 2011 version of the project, the new Nike Mags were designed for a good cause. In order to be in the running for a pair, interested partiesneed to donate $10to theMichael J. Fox Foundation. Individuals can donate as many times as they want, with proceeds going to help fight Parkinson’s disease.

The drawing starts October 4 and is open primarily to the U.S. and Canada. Winners will be notified on October 17. Nike will also be holding live auctions in Hong Kong, London and New York in coming months.

Those who don’t score one of the extremely limited pairs, meanwhile,will have to settle for the next best thing.
