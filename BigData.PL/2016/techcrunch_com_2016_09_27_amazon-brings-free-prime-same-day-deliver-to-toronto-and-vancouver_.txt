Amazon brings free Prime same-day delivery to Toronto and Vancouver

Amazon continues to roll-out its free same-day delivery offering for Prime subscribers, adding Toronto and Vancouver to the list of cities where it’s available. The free same-day option applies to items labeled as eligible via the ‘Prime FREE Same-Day’ tag located next to the price in a product’s listing.

Orders placed earlier in the day will be delivered by 9 PM, while those placed after the cut-off will be delivered by 9 PM the next day, and there’s no additional cost. For non-Prime members, same-day delivery is also available, but it costs $11.99 per order and an additional $1.99 per pound, per item after that.

Perhaps most notably, Prime same-day delivery is available seven days a week, including Saturday and Sunday, which are not typically days when Canadians expect to be able to receive packages.

Amazon began offering free same-day delivery in select U.S. cities about a year ago, and expanded the offering to 11 more cities in the U.S. in April.
