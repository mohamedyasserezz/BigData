Join TechCrunch at SOMA, The Musical

Whether in the once-sizzling pages of Valleywag or on the screen of HBO, most of SV can, at the very least, tolerate a good roast.

Either way, we’d better all be ready.

The next roast is coming soon in the form ofSOMA, The Musical. SOMA is a new comedy about SV’s worst offenders — the breathless founders, the sleazy venture capitalists and yes, even the touchy tech media. It’s really fun and we’d like you tojoin uson Saturday, October 22 to see what the fuss is about.

The cast is a mix of techies from Microsoft, Dropbox, Yammer, Ginger.io, NoRedInk and LendingKarma, along with some real theater professionals who have performed with the Academy of Arts, the Boston Conservatory and locally at Beach Blanket Babylon, Alameda Opera, Pacific Repertory and End Games Improv.

SOMA features a Wall Street Journal writer playing a venture capitalist, a venture capitalist playing a founder and a founder playing a construction worker.

The show was co-written by Pat Blute, the writer ofSpears, a musical about Jesus set to Britney Spears music last performed at the Foxwoods Theater in NYC, and TechCrunch’s own Sam O’Keefe.

Tareq Abuissa, composer and lyricist, ties the show together with musical numbers highlighting the need to “Pivot,” how “Helpful” VCs can be and the need for “Disruption” of diversity issues in tech.
