Meizu looks to fill a Note 7-shaped hole with the Pro 6 Plus

Over the past few months, Samsung has been understandably manic, trying to get replacement phones in the hands of former Note 7 owners. According to the company’s public-facing numbers, its bids have been pretty successful, convincing customers to stick with the brand by way of the S7 and S7 Edge, even as confidence in the brand has been deeply shaken.

There are, of course, plenty of options on the market today for those less bullish on the brand – similarly specked devices from big and small names. The Meizu Pro 6 Plus unveiled today, however, just might be Samsung’s closest competitor note for note – as it were.

The display is a 5.7-inch QHD Super AMOLED at 1440 x 2560, and the underlying chipset is Samsung’s own Exynos 8890. The battery’s pretty sizeable as well, though at 3,400mAh, it’s just shy of the Note’s 3,500. The 12-megapixel camera is likely to be a step down, as well, though the company’s shifted a bit of focus to that front, with improved low light shooting and ISP for noise reduction.

And then, of course, there are all of the fixings you get on the Note after six generations of tweaks – the S Pen, security, et al. The Pro 6 Plus does get some software upgrades, however, with a new version of the company’s Android skin, Flyme OS. Version 6. There are 400 new features by Meizu’s count, including a new design and the One Mind “AI Engine” – though there’s still very little in the way of detail as far as what any of all of that means.

The other downside is a pretty big one here in the US, at least – for the time being, sales of the Pro 6 Plus appear to be restricted to Asia and Europe.
