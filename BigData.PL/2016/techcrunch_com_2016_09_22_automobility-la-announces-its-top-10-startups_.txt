AutoMobility LA announces its top 10 startups

AutoMobility LA, the new name for the press days before the publicLA Auto Showin November, has announced the ten startups competing for visibility and mentoring opportunities. The board that chooses the finalists includes executives from companies small and large, new and old: Lyft, Google, NVIDIA, Local Motors, and General Electric, among others.

The startups that made the list cover a wide range of automotive technologies, from cybersecurity to ride hailing to service apps. There are no automakers like Elio Motors this year, but there is one company that is building foldable scooters for last-mile commuting.

Here are the top ten:

All of these companies will be exhibiting at AutoMobility LA in the Technology Pavilion. The LA Auto Show has had a Connected Car Expo for the past few years, but this is a pivot toward the future of transportation that puts more emphasis on technology, cleaner fuels, and shared ownership. It seems that the LA Auto Show is setting itself up for a time when auto shows as we know them will be obsolete.

It’s also likely its organizers feelCESbreathing down their necks. In 2016, there were more than 100 automotive tech companies at CES, and nine automotive manufacturers with huge auto-show-style displays and press events. Detroit is feeling the pressure too. The North American International Auto Show, which butts up against CES on the calendar in January, has a newAutoMobili-Dspace to showcase autonomous and connected vehicles as well as Mobility as a Service (MaaS).

Back to AutoMobility and these top ten startups. Three of these companies will be mentored on stage at the event by investor Bill Tai, and from those three, an ultimate winner will be announced. That team will attend the final celebration of the2017 Extreme Tech Challenge, where they can rub elbows with those competitors and judges on Sir Richard Branson’s Necker Island.
