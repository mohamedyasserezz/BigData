Google’s cloud chief Diane Greene will join us at Disrupt SF

The cloud services that Google uses to power its own services are second to none. But for the longest time, the company couldn’t get a foothold in the quickly growing cloud computing business while competitors like Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft Azure were growing rapidly. To right this ship, Google brought inDiane Greenebyacquiringher startup BeBop Technologies for $348 million last year and named her its VP of Google Cloud Enterprise.

Greene will join us at Disrupt SF in September to talk about Google’s ambitions in the cloud and how she plans to bring more enterprises onto Google’s platform.

Few people have Greene’s experience in the enterprise. Before striking out on her own again with bebop, she was the CEO of VMware, where she oversaw deals like that company’s acquisition by EMC. She shepherded VMware through its IPO in 2007 and then left in 2008.

Greene joined Google’s board of directors in 2012, so she’s no stranger to the company and its overall vision.

“It is Google’s time for enterprise,” she told our own Ron Miller inan interviewearlier this year. “Google has a lot to offer the world and it all came together in a nice way. There was just a lot of effort going on around the enterprise that has set things up really well.”

With Google now putting its massive resources behind expanding its enterprise offerings, this will surely be an interesting conversation on our Disrupt stage.
