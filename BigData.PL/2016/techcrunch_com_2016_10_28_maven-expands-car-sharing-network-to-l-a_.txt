Maven expands car-sharing network to L.A.

GM’sMavencar-sharing service is adding yet another city to the list of places where it’s available: Los Angeles. The addition of L.A. comes quick on the heels of its recentexpansion into San Francisco, which means there are now two California markets on board.

Maven is GM’s in-house alternative to offerings like Zipcar and Enterprise CarShare. The program will host an initial fleet of 60 cars for members to choose from in L.A., available on-demand 24 hours, from pick-up locations located in the downtown, Little Tokyo and South Park areas of the city to begin with, with planned expansions down the road.

Maven is also touting over 23 million miles driven across 12,000 reservations at this point, after a launch in early 2016. That number also includes makes driven via GM’s Express Drive program with Lyft, whereby drivers who want to act as service providers for the on-demand ridesharing network can rent out cars on demand, too.

“Los Angeles is a natural fit for Maven because of the city’s incredible appetite for cars,” said Julia Steyn, vice president of Urban Mobility and Maven in a press release.

Part of GM’s goal with Maven is showcasing new vehicles, which means members get access to Chevy Cruze, Malibu, Tahoe, Volt, as well as GMC Acadia and Yukon, and Cadillac ATS, CTS, CT6, XT5 and Escalade. Drivers will be charged a rate depending on their vehicle, starting at $8 per hour and with daily rates also available. All cars include OnStar, and in-car 4G LTE wireless connections.
