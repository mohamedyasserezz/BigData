And this is why VR headsets are headsets and not sunglasses

They fall off. A lot. And nothing rips you from the escapism of VR faster than having a pair of glasses constantly fall off the bridge of your nose. No sudden movements and you should be fine.

I’m not saying never to the idea. I can certainly see a time in the not too distant future when such devices might become practical. For now, however, there are too many wires tethering you to reality, too much weight frontloading glasses. I don’t know, maybe you can get one of those dorky sunglass bands people used to wear in the 1980s. For now it all seems an inelegant solution to an unnecessary problem.

For its part, unfortunately named VR startup Dlodlo (really?) is already talking about future-generation products — ones that are slimmer, wireless. When that happens, we can definitely revisit this conversation. For the time being, however, there’s little more appeal to the project than the one sentence pitch, “hey kids, VR sunglasses!”

I tried the glasses on. They didn’t offer much over your standard headset — in fact, they were really less immersive than the majority of VR products out there. But they make you look more like “Rowdy” Roddy Piper inThey Livethan the Rift or Vive, and, ultimately, that has to count for something.
