Google’s head of diversity is leaving the company

Google’s head of diversity, Nancy Lee, is retiring from Google after several years of leading the company’s global diversity and inclusion team, TechCrunch has learned.

Lee, who originally joined Google’s legal team back in 2006, has been working on diversity at Google for the last few years. She started her diversity efforts as director of people operations in 2010, and became vice president of people operations in 2013.

As head of people operations, Lee has overseen a number of initiatives, like diversity trainings and a Googler in Residence program that places Google employees at historically black colleges and universities. She’s also led the charge to increase diverse representation at the company.

In Google’s latest diversity report, we saw that overall representation of women went from30 percent female in 2014to 31 percent female in 2015. But the overall percentage of black and Hispanic people did not increase at all, with overall representation of blacks remaining at 2 percent and Hispanics remaining at 3 percent. In 2015, only 4 percent of Google’s hires were black and 5 percent of its hires were Hispanic.

It’s not clear who will take over as head of diversity or when Lee’s last day is. Google declined to comment for this story.
