Kyocera’s new rugged handset doubles as an action cam

Rugged is just kind of Kyocera’s thing, when it comes to handsets, andthe new DuraForce Prodoes its best to uphold that tradition with a Military Standard 810G grade rugged body and IP68 certification, which its dustproof and can withstand a two meter dunking for up to 30 minutes.

None of that’s really all that different for the line, but the Pro does bring a newfound focus on camera features, in an attempt to offer bundle an Android smartphone and GoPro-style action cam. That means a 13-megapixel camera on the rear (couple with a 5MP selfie machine on the front), a 135-degree field of view and an on-board image process that gives it action, sports, slow-motion and underwater modes.

The camera’s rugged five-inch 1920×1080 display doubles as a viewfinder, which should couple nicely with the forthcoming action camera mounts, while built-in cellular connectivity means videos can be posted directly from the device.

There’s a 3,240mAh battery on board, along with front-facing speakers, and, interestingly enough, some enterprise focused features for the action sports enthusiast who really needs file paperwork in the field.
