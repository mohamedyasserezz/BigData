Microsoft will introduce a new Surface device on October 26

On the 26thday of the 10thmonth of the year, Microsoft willbe showcasing some big Windows 10 newsat an event in New York City. The company just sent out invites, and while they don’t reveal a heck of a lot about what’s going down (just a lot of backwards text), we hear that the company will be launching a new Surface device at the event — exactly what remains to be seen.

The timing is certainly right on, both in terms of getting into the holiday swing of things just under wire and the fact that, just about this time last year, the company held a major event here in the city, in which it showed off a bunch of new pieces of hardware, including the Surface Pro 4, Microsoft Band 2 and debuted the Surface Book laptop.

Word has leaked out that the company won’t be giving the Band line another shot this time around, but a new entry in the company’s proprietary hardware line does seem imminent in the days leading up to Halloween. We’ll be there covering the event live, naturally.
