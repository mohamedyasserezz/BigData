Lenovo’s got a snazzy new lightweight convertible laptop

The poor Yoga 910 never really had a chance. Moments after Lenovo announced the laptop, the spotlight was completely absorbed by the strange new Yoga Book. It’s a shame really, because this is a pretty nice piece of hardware — one that surely would have been the talk of the company’s event, had it not gone and showed the aforementioned device and a Hasselblad add-on for the Moto Z.

The Yoga 910 is an update to last year’s stellar 900, featuring the company’s signature hinge design that has also made its way onto the Yoga Book, letting the device contort into a laptop, stand or tablet. The new model also shaves some precious fractions of an inch off its predecessor, down to 0.56.

And while the notebook is a touch heavier than the 910 at 3.04 pounds (versus 2.85), that seems like a small price to pay for upscaling the screen from 13.3 to 13.9 inches (along with some extremely skinny bezel action).

Users looking to upgrade can also opt for a 4K version, which comes in at an impressive 3,840-by-2,160. Inside the thing is a seventh-gen Intel Kaby Lake processor, which is plenty zippy and should add some battery life to the laptop, thanks to increased power efficiency.

The 910 has a premium look and feel as well — even if the aluminum version I looked at did have a certainly MacBooky vibe. If you’re so inclined, you can just go straight matte black if you want to stay true to your Lenovo roots. It starts at $1,299.
