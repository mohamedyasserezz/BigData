The assimilation of robots into the workforce as peers, not replacements

One might ask why we would ever want to createrobotsthat can do human work when we have so many people who need jobs. The goal of robotics shouldnotbe to replace humans withrobots, but rather to improve productivity and safety, removing humans from harm’s way and enabling them to focus on things that humans should be doing.

We can agree that humans shouldn’t be carrying heavy loads, exposing themselves to radiation or finding land mines. What is less clear is the gray area, where the line that divides human and robot competency is becoming blurred. People wonder whetherrobotswill displace their jobs. It’s an important question, especially because it’s already obvious that robotics has impacted theworkforce.

Which industries will see the greatest integration of robotics, and which ones are likelynotto be impacted? There are a number of misconceptions, and even fears, about theassimilationofrobotsin the workplace. Overcoming these involves a greater understanding of the value of humans versusrobotsand the current technological limitations torobots. Includingrobotsin the workplace isnotan “all or nothing” scenario. The most important question is how humans androbotsshould work together to improve quality and safety rather than howrobotscan replace humans.

What people rarely understand is that roboticsdoesn’t necessarily produce a net loss in human jobs. One of my colleagues helped develop the Kivarobots,which eventually became the basis of Amazon’s logistic centers. He explained that the original appeal ofrobotswas that they would reduce the human laborworkforce. That never happened. What did happen was that therobotsmassively improved the productivity of each human, allowing Amazon to scale operations. No human was ever fired — in fact, more humans were hired.

The same thing was true for my work with militaryrobots. The original premise signedintolaw by Congress was that half of our armed forces would become unmanned. The original aim was to cut labor costs, but, as with Amazon, the labor savings never came. What did happen is thatrobotssaved lives and improved the safety and productivity of each soldier by conducting tasks like landmine detection and mapping out radiation and chemical spills. It also created a lot of jobs associated with building, maintaining and usingrobots.

A Pew Research Centerstudyindicated that although technology is often sold as a means to reduce labor, it may actually create more high-paying jobs than the low-paying jobs it eliminates. However, the study also indicated a broad concern regarding how the use ofrobotswill play out. When asked how robotics and self-driving cars would impact theworkforce, 48 percent of experts surveyed believed thatrobotswould directly displace human workers for both blue-collar and white-collar jobs. On the other hand, 52 percent believed that robotics will create more jobs than it displaces.

Gartner estimates there are6.4 billion “connected things”in the world around us. The volume of sensor data coming from these connected entities is expected to increase dramatically, accounting for more and more of thetotal data in our world.Robotsare poised to be crucial arbiters of the new, machine-intensive ecosystem of sensors, interfaces and actuators that we are building up all around us at home and in the workplace.Robotscan handle the complexity of this increasingly intricate world, allowing our attention to focus on the humans around us rather than on screens, buttons and keys.

The more time we spend training ourselves to surf the net and text, the less our livesresemblehuman lives of the last century. Today it is entirely possible that we are becoming robot-like faster thanrobotsare becoming like humans. This isnotan inevitable course, but rather something we are consciously deciding to do. We need to carefully consider how much we value direct human interaction.

Part of this is preference, but profit and performance considerations may override our preferences. From a performance perspective, humans androbotsarenotnecessarily good at the same things; we need to both comprehend and plan for the differences between humans androbots. In biology, co-evolutionary development occurs when two species evolve in relation to each other. In an ideal future, robotics applications will allow us to embrace the unique, vital essence of what it means to be human — creativity, imagination, love — and prevent the need for us to become more like machines.

We need to objectively differentiate ourselves and our skills from whatrobotscan do. The general wisdom, based on understanding ofrobotsfrom the past decade, is that humans are good at high-level decision making and understanding the purpose and context for a task.Robotsare generally good at repetitive physical labor and reactive, high-precision tasks that require careful attention to detail. With a new generation ofrobotson the way, this understanding may need to change.

I seem to have very interesting discussions whenever I get a haircut. One day I was explaining to my hairdresser that I work withrobotsand she stopped cutting, visibly upset and remarked that she would probably be out of a job before too long because of the development of robotic intelligence. I thought about it, and realized thatrobotswould most likely replace my job before they replaced hers.

Her job was really, really hard. She had to take hopelessly vague tasking like: “Give me a George Clooney haircut but kind of a bit more fun and crazy.” What does that mean? I can pretty well guarantee that a robot won’t ever know what that means. Regardless of trying to understand the semantics, a much harder task is figuring out how many small scissor cuts will result in an emerging look. Cutting hair isnotan easy job; I know I could never do it. I believe it would scare any robot as well.

I told my hairdresser she had nothing to worry about, but she still looked at me skeptically. What she didn’t realize is that even ifrobotscould cut hair effectively, she still had a major advantage. She had softly massaged my head and neck before she started cutting and she breezily discussed just about any topic while making her customer feel at ease.

Machines will impact the jobs of surgeons and professors long before they impact her job. We already haverobots thatperform surgical tasks more precisely and reliably than human hands. Likewise, distance education and automated testing are already changing the landscape for education. Hair cutting remains a domain where human artisans reign supreme.

Humans excel when resourcefulness and contextual understanding are important. It is difficult to imagine a robot with the broad range of problem solving, general purpose knowledge and dexterity necessary to be a facility superintendent: fixing broken garbage disposals and broken toilets, maintaining the boiler, replacing a leaky pipe, etc.Robotsstruggle in these unstructured environments where MacGyver-like problem solving is necessary. Like the hairdresser, apartment superintendents have little to fear fromrobotsany time soon. As we consider the complexity of various human jobs, we must rethinknotonly what we value in general, but how we pay people in particular. Maybe we’ll end up paying hairdressers and building superintendents more than surgeons and professors?

Robotswill change the contours of ourworkforce, but hopefully for the better. Even the professor and surgeon, who can already see impact from various forms of robotics and AI, neednotfeel that technology is replacing them. The advent of the calculator didnotsteal something vital from mathematicians. It did change what we value from them. Few of us feel enmity with calculators because we’re generally happy to let calculators outperform us in that arena.Robotswill be much more than calculators, but still the key will be to ensure that we value the right things.

We need to ensure a framework where human input and robot input can be properly interwoven. All too often, we focus on either full human control or full autonomy, and neither of these is likely to be optimal.

While working with the Department of Energy we found that operators who had spent many years honing their ability to driverobotswith joysticks were quite resistant to the notion that therobotscould do the driving for them. In one experiment,operatorsdrove the course twice, once in a mode where the robot took no initiative and once in a shared control mode where the human felt like they were in control but the robot wove its way through hallways and openings.

As expected, performance was significantly better in the mode where the robot helped with the driving. Less expected were the operators’ responses when asked about their “feeling of control.” They actually reported feeling more in control while using the mode where the robot did most of the driving. They took the credit for the good driving when really it was robot initiative that made them successful.

Humans often don’t know what they’re good at, but the introduction of a well-structured human-robot interaction approach can help us maintain high-level control while taking away the low-level details.

If we can get the task allocation right, the humans of the future won’t be fighting withrobotsto shovel dirt, find landmines or drive mining equipment. Rather, humans will be caring for people and having interesting conversations about how to make the world a better place. They should be doing whatever they love and spending time with whomever they love — which will hopefullynotbe a robot.

Despite persistent fears regarding robot overlords, we will be as free as we choose to make ourselves. We can do thisnotby fighting withrobotsbut by fighting fiercely to maintain our distinctness and our essential nature.
