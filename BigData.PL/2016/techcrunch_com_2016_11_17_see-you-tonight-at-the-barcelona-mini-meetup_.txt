See you tonight at the Barcelona Mini Meetup

It’s almost here! The Barcelona Mini Meetup is happening tonight at 7pm and we’re getting ready for you. The event is being held at Bar Denou, Carrer de Pallars 122, in Barcelona and will last until about 10pm. Please be on time, especially if you were chosen to pitch.

You canRSVP here. I’ve added 10 free tickets and a few paid “Late-Bird” tickets. Grab them quickly.

A few TC writers will be there and we’ll try to hold a pitch-off for tickets to Disrupt in London. It will be an informal event with no agenda aside from networking and pitching.

See you all soon!
