Google celebrates Olympics with Doodle Fruit Games

The Olympics kick off this week and to celebrate, Google is featuring anew interactive doodlein the Google App for iOS and Android every day for the next seven days (and they will all be available for ten days after that).

So if you couldn’t make it to Rio (which may be for the better, given all theissuesthe citycurrentlyfaces) you can now guide a bunch of delicious fruits through a mock Olympic decathlon where the greatest threat is being literally steamrolled by an overly aggressive melon. Even the Fruit Games are dangerous.

Google hopes you will find these fruits as “apPEELing” as it does (yep – Google wrote that, but I’m sure it’ll make sense when you play the Apple game). From what I can see, there is a biking game (you play a coconut on a BMX bike), water polo, spider hurdle jumping, a coconut and pineapple playing tennis, and more. You can also play a cute berry that is trying to avoid getting turned into a smoothie by an overly aggressive (yet oddly happy) melon that doesn’t exactly exhibit the Olympic spirit.

Clearly, somebody at Google had a lot of fun putting all of this together.
