U.S. aims to create 48 national EV charging corridors, across 25K miles of highway

The Obama Administration announced on Thursday that it will create 48 national charging corridors for electric vehicles, covering off 25,000 miles of U.S. highways running through 35 states. The initiative will include a partnership between 28 states, local utilities, EV charging companies and car makers GM, BMW and Nissan.

Reutersreportsthat the combination of stakeholders is designed to help “jump start” the addition of more EV charging stations into the mix, perhaps accelerating the pace beyond what any individual concern working along would be able to accomplish.

One company that has already been trying to blanket the country in accessible charging stations for electric vehicles is Tesla, which passed the 700 mark forSupercharger sites globallyearlier this year. Tesla plans to expand the network even further across the U.S. this year, as you can see from its projected Supercharger location map current as of this writing:

In June, the White House announced the expansion of a federal loan program for promoting EV use to include hardware and software for charging facilities, with a max loan value of $4.5 billion total across the program for energy programs. At that time, the administration announced it was partnering with around 50 stakeholders, including automakers like Tesla, GM, Ford, Nissan, BMW, and Daimler to promote EV charging station creation.
