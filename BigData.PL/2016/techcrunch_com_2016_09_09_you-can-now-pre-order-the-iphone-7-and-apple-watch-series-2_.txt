You can now pre-order the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2

When Apple announced theiPhone 7andApple Watch Series 2earlier this week the company said pre-orders would start Friday September 9th, which in recent years has meant as early as 12:01am Pacific Time or 3:01am Eastern Time on the 9th.

This year is no different, as the company just flipped the switch onits retail websiteas well as in the Apple Store app, so customers can now start placing pre-orders for both devices. As usual, carriers likeAT&TandVerizonare also both accepting pre-orders, as well as newcomersBest BuyandTargetthis year.

The iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2 will officially be available on September 16th, and if this year is similar to years past, those that pre-ordered early will be able to pick up or receive delivery of their device on launch day.

It’s always a little tough to say how exactly these pre-orders will go, as some years pre-order stock has lasted throughout the entire day, and other years it was gone within an hour or two.

For what it’s worth, Applewon’t be disclosingsales numbers from opening weekend and pre-order sales as it has done in the past. However, the company has essentially said they expect the new iPhone to “sell out”, and that this launch will be governed by supply not demand.

If you’re still trying to decide if you’re going to pre-order something tonight,here’s our recapof everything launched at the event on Wednesday.
