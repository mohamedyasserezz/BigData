Oracle CEO Safra Catz joins Trump transition team

Oracle’s chief executive Safra Catz will join President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team, an Oracle spokesperson told TechCrunch.

Catz was one of several top tech executives thatattended a meeting with Trump, his children and his advisors yesterday at Trump Tower in New York. Catz was the most outspokenly optimistic attendee prior to the meeting, saying, “I plan to tell the President-elect that we are with him and are here to help in any way we can.”

Catz added that she hoped Trump would reform the tax code, reduce regulation and negotiate trade deals that would benefit the tech community.

Catz will remain in her role as CEO at Oracle while working on the transition. TechCrunch asked Oracle about the nature of Catz’s role on the transition team and will update if the company provides further detail.

Unlike some of the other attendees of Trump’s tech summit, Catz was not particularly outspoken about politics during the election season. Federal Election Commission data shows no contributions to presidential candidates in Catz’s name, although the CEO has donated to Republican and Democratic Congressional campaigns. Larry Ellison, Oracle’s chairman, is a Republican mega-donor who contributed millions to a super PAC that backed Marco Rubio’s failed presidential bid.
