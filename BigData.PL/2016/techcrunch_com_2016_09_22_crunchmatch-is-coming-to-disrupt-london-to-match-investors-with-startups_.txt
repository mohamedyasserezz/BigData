CrunchMatch is coming to Disrupt London to match investors with startups

At Disrupt London, this coming December, it will be easier than ever for investors to find companies that fit their investment strategy. For the first time TechCrunch is bringing its CrunchMatch program to Europe where startup founders will be matched with venture capitalists ready to write checks and make investments.

This is CrunchMatch

TechCrunch’s new program to curate meetings between investors and startups is a hit.

At TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2016, TechCrunch helped 50 investors and 76 startups make a total of nearly 200 connection meetings at Disrupt. We’re thrilled to announce that CrunchMatch will be coming with us across the pond atDisrupt London 2016.

How it works: When an investor registers for Disrupt, they’ll receive an invitation to fill out a questionnaire about their investment interests. Startups in the Battlefield and those which purchase Startup Alley ticket packages will receive a similar form.

TechCrunch will use those responses to match investors with startups that fit their investment profile and interest areas. We’ll also help coordinate those meetings at a private space and at a time that works for both parties during the course of the Disrupt conference.

CrunchMatch investors at Disrupt NY raved about the experience, with 85% of participating using CrunchMatch to scout future investments, and 93% of investors saying they would participate in CrunchMatch again.

Investor Breakfast

Want to compare notes with other investor at Disrupt? Join us on Monday, 5 December for an Investor Breakfast. This breakfast is a way for TechCrunch to bring together investors who are registered for Disrupt to network with each other and with the TechCrunch team. An invitation to the Investor Breakfast will come in the weeks preceding Disrupt once an investor has registered for a ticket to the conference. The TechCrunch team will make a brief presentation and take questions from attendees.
