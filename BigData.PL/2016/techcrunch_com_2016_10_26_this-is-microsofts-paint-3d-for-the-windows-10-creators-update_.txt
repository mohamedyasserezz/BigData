This is Microsoft’s Paint 3D for the Windows 10 Creator’s Update

Microsoft has just announced Paint 3D, an update to its long-standing art creation program for Windows that makes it easy to create 3D art for everyone, according to the company. This includes a new destination for sharing creations calledRemix 3D. Included in the update is a way to export 3D creations directly from Minecraft, too, and 3D print them if you have a printer.

The update also includes a partnership with SketchUp, which is a 3D creation community which already has millions of users on its platform. This should help make it easy for Paint 3D users to grab 3D objects made available by the community to integrate them into their own creations in the desktop app.

On stage at the event, Microsoft GM Megan Saunders showed off how the app works, including 3D doodling tools using the Microsoft Surface pen, as well as the incorporation of pre-set assets, 2D images and original creations. Saunders also demonstrated exporting these creations to Facebook, meaning you should be able to share them easily across existing social networks.
