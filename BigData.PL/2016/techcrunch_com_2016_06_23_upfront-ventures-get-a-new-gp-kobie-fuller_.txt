Upfront Ventures gets a new GP: Kobie Fuller

Kobie Fuller, who has worked as a principal withAccel Partnerssince 2013, is joining L.A.-basedUpfront Venturesas a general partner. Previously, Fuller was CMO at Revolve, a fashion-e-commerce company in L.A. He also spent several years as an associate withInsight Venture Partnersearlier in his career.

According to Upfront’s managing partnerMark Suster, Fuller had led investments at Accel in software startupsUserTestingandEmergent VR. He also invested as an angel in the VR headset maker Oculus VR before Facebook acquired it for $2 billion.

Upfront first became acquainted with Fuller through two companies where Accel is a co-investor: the SaaS marketing platformInvoca(Fuller sat on its board) and educational game makerOsmo, where Fuller held what’s called an observer seat. (Accel’s Rich  Wong is on the company’s board.)

Fuller will be moving from the Bay Area to L.A. later this summer for his new post.

Upfront, which now has six general partners, raised its most recent fund, a$280 millionvehicle, in late 2014. Given the current pace of venture fundraising broadly speaking, one would guess the firm will be back in the market early next year.
