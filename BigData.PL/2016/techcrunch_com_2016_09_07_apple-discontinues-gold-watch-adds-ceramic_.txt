Apple discontinues gold watch, adds ceramic

Remember those$17,000 Apple Watches?Well it looks like the gold Apple Watch Edition is not part of the new collection.

When the company unveiled the new Apple Watch Series 2 on Wednesday, they announced that it will be available in aluminum, stainless steel and a new material, ceramic. Prices start at $369.

They’ve also updated the original Apple Watch with a better dual core processor. It’s unclear whether this Series 1 Watch will still be available in gold.

The less expensive “Sport” line, will still have gold-coloring as an option for the aluminum bands. They are also available in rose gold, space gray and silver.

Focusing on fashion, Apple expanded on its line ofHermes bands. The high-end designer sells the watches in its stores.

It’s likely that Apple will continue to seek luxury brand associations, in its efforts to suggest that its Watch represents quality and style.

Theupdated Apple Watchresembles the original version that was unveiled two years ago, but with some improvements. It has a longer battery life, includes GPS and it’s waterproof.
