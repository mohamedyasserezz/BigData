Sony’s profit down 86% but its costly mobile business has been shored up

Sony’s profit dropped 86 percent year-on-year as the strong performance of the Japanese Yen, fallout from the Kumamoto earthquake and company restructuring weighed onits Q2 2016 earnings.

The Japanese electronics giant posted a small $48 million (4.8 billion JPY) profit in its Q2 2016 financial period,down from $205 million last year.On the positive side, though, its mobile business again showed that it has stopped bleeding cash.

The Sony Mobile business had long impacted earnings,costing it over $500 millionover its last financial year, but thanks to downsizing and a focus on models with higher margins its performance has been shored up. Sony Mobile Communications carded a $37 million (3.7 billion JPY) profit for Q2, a huge improvement on the $172 million (20.6 billion) loss from one year ago and progress onthe previous quarter’s ¥400 million ($4 million) operating profit.

Sony sold 3.5 million smartphones in its most recent quarter, although total sales were down 40 percent year-on-year as the company reduced its mid-range product family and concentrated on regions where it is strongest.

Sony’s PlayStation business, its most notable performer, saw sales decline by 11 percent year-on-year primarily due to currency changes. With 319.9 billion JPY ($3.2 billion) generated from the quarter, it was again Sony’s top performing business unit.

Elsewhere, the home entertainment business posted a $174 million (17.6 billion JPY) profit, up 11 percent year-on-year despite revenue declining 19 percent over the same period. Sony’s semiconductor business was impacted by Kumamoto, carding a $41 million (4.2 billion JPY) loss as revenue dipped five percent annually. Its component business also reported a loss for Q2 2016 — $363 million (36.6 billion JPY) — as increased competition in batteries took its toll.

There were positive results for Sony in the media space with its Pictures business — $32 million (3.2 billion JPY) profit as revenue rose five percent — and Sony Music, profit up 15 percent to $164 million, 16.5 billion JPY.
