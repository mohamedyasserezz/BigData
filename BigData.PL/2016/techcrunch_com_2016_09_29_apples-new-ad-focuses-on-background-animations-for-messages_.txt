Apple’s new ad focuses on background animations for Messages

Apple is releasing a new video advertisement for the iPhone and iOS. Likeprevious ads, this video shows a stark departure from its predecessors. You can feelTor Myhren’s influence on this ad.

The recently hired VP of Marketing Communications has an impressive background in the advertising industry and is now in charge of Apple’s ads. That’s probably the reason why these ads look more polished and try to tell a story compared to last year’s ads.

Today’s new ad doesn’t show an iPhone until the last seconds. Instead, Apple slowly reveals what happens when you lose a balloon.

At the end, you realize it’s all about theMessages effects in iOS 10. It’s a cute ad and it doesn’t try to sell you a product. It’s more about improving Apple’s branding as iOS 10 is a free download after all.
