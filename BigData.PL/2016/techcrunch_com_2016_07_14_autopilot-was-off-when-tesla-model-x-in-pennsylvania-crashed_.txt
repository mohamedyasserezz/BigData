Tesla has been criticized over the last weeks for, as some say anyhow, offering its Autopilot semi-autonomous driving feature too early and using public roads as proving grounds. Consumer Reports just todaycalled for the company to disable the featureuntil it’s safer.

The news that it wasn’t even in use at the time of the crash should silence some critics, but hardly all: The full story of the crash isn’t known yet, and while Autopilot does not appear to be the cause, it may yet have contributed. Until a more thorough investigation yields its results, it may be best to withhold judgment — not that anyone will do that.

This story is developing; more info as we get it.
