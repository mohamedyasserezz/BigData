Announcing the Disrupt SF Startup Battlefield competition judges

Startup Battlefield is back. In just a few short weeks, TechCrunch’s premiere startup competition will kick off at Disrupt SF and we’re excited to announce the judges tasked with determining which company will take up the Disrupt Cup and $50,000.

This year the competition features 23 young companies vying for attention and funding. Each will have six minutes to impress their panel of judges in a bid to make the final round of five companies.

At Disrupt SF each day starts with panels and one-on-one discussions featuring TechCrunch writers and editors, special guest speakers, leading venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. In the afternoon, we host theStartup Battlefield competitionwhich culminates in five finalists taking the stage at the end of the event for a shot at winning the Disrupt Cup and a $50,000 check.
