Purch acquires small-business site Business.com

Digital media companyPurchhas acquiredBusiness.com— which, in addition to being a pretty great URL, offers advice and other content for small businesses and operates a marketplace for business products and services.

Purch owns a number of product-focused sites, including Tom’s Guide and AnandTech. It raiseda $135 millionround last year and has continued to grow its portfolio through acquisitions since then, most recently bybuying mobile shopping startup ShopSavvy.

As for Business.com, it was founded back in 1999 and is currently run by Resource Nation, whichacquired the brand and assets(with funding from JMI Equity) back in 2011.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Purch CEO Greg Mason told me (via email) that after the acquisition, the Business.com website “will continue to operate under its own name and remain a leading online resource portal for small business owners — providing robust content and trusted advice for its loyal user base.”

“Business.com’s content and assets will complement Purch’s business model of combining content and commerce to enable users to make smart purchase decisions,” he added.

Mason declined to comment on how many Business.com employees would be joining Purch, but he did say his team is working closely with them “on integration plans that leverage the combined Purch and Business.com assets to effectively serve small business owners looking to grow their business.”
