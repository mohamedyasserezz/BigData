Google Maps gets multi-stop directions and vacation memories on mobile

Google is bringing long awaited multi-stop directions to mobile with its new summer update. Travelers can now hit as many tourist traps as they want on their cross country treks. Just like in the web version, users can swiftly rearrange the order of stops. Android users will get the feature first, followed by iOS in the near future.

The summer update caps off an active week for Maps. Earlier this week, Google alsorolled out sharper satellite imagery.

Google also wants to help travelers remember everything from ruralice minesto giant Adirondack chairs with its new Timeline feature. Your Timeline is for those moments when you just can’t remember that definitely fun memorable thing you did last Wednesday to tell your friends and family. Users can drop notes right next to activities. Unfortunately this feature seems to be only rolling out for Android users at this time.

All we need now is an update for multi-planet directions and a nifty feature to track time dilation.
