Apple is replacing faulty batteries on ‘a very small number’ of iPhone 6s devices

‘Tis the season for Apple replacement programs, it appears. Days afterthe U.S. tech giant addressed ‘touch disease’ on certain iPhone 6 Plusdevices, soApple has announceda battery replacement program for iPhone 6s owners affected by unexpected shutdowns.

Apple said the problem impacts “a very small number” of iPhone 6s devices that were made between September and October last year. In those cases, the phone may unexpectedly shut down due to issues with the battery.

Owners of affected devices can go to their nearest Apple Store to check the serial number of their device — which should identify whether it is part of the malfunctioning batch — and then get a free battery replacement, if needed.

Apple said the battery problem doesn’t affect the safety of the devices like, say, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. In case you’ve been living under a stone over the past few months,Samsung was forced to recall the deviceandpermanently cease salesdue safety fears over defective batteries.
