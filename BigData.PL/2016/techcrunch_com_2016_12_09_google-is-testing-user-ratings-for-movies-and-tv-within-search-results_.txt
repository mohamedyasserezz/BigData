Google is testing user ratings for movies and TV within search results

Google is disrupting yet another industry by including light-weight services directly within search results. This time, Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb, with Google testing out movie ratings from within search itself.

Google confirmed toSearch Engine Landthat the feature is currently just an experiment, and beyond that, the company has nothing to announce at this time.

Unlike other movie and TV rating platforms, Google’s feature is not on a scale from one to five but instead offers a binary choice: like or dislike.

The feature itself isn’t all that interesting, but it’s worth recognizing each small step Google takes toward layering over the internet.

Information about weather, ticket purchasing options and more used to be available on unique, individual websites. Today, however, Google has incorporated this information and functionality into the search results layer of its own service.

Within the movie ratings feature, users will also be able to see the Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb ratings for the title, as they always have.

As I said before, the feature is just an experiment for now, so some users may not see it when they search for a movie or TV show.
