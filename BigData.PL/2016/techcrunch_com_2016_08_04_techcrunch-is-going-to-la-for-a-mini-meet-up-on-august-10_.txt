TechCrunch is going to LA for a mini-meetup on August 10

TechCrunch is going to be in Los Angeles next week and we want you to come hang out with us. We’ll be hosting a mini-meetup next Wednesday, August 10, from 6-8 p.m. at WeWork’s brand spankin’ new Culver City location. Come hang out with some of your favorite TechCrunch writers and the sexy TC video team for a good time over drinks and apps to discuss tech, news and your thoughts onL.A. eco-living experiments in shipping containers.

We’ll be showing up in the TechCrunch video team “CrunchWagon.” We haven’t even seen it yet, so not exactly sure what to expect, but I’m hoping for it to be a cross between theBatmobileand theScooby-Doo Mystery Machine. Should be fun.

There are only a few hundred spots to hang out with us next week, so you’ll need to get your ticketheresoon. This is a 21+ event and we will be checking IDs at the door.

Get your tickets today before we run out!If we’re sold out already, you can put your name on a waiting listhere.See you in Los Angeles!
