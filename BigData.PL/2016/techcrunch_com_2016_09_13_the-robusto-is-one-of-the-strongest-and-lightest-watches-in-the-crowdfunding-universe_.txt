The Robusto is one of the strongest and lightest watches in the crowdfunding universe

Watches like theOmega Ploprofand, now, thebulbous-looking Robusto, are designed for rough and ready wear. The watch, created by a Dutch company calledTime22features a titanium case and automatic movement and should be able to withstand pressure, smacks, and damage.

The watch is made of Grade 5 titanium and is water-resistant to 200 meters. It runs an ETA or quartz movement and starts at $400 for the entry-level quartz model. It weighs 130 grams and has a 45mm face which means it’s surprisingly light for its size. The face is fully lumed with Superluminova.

They are raising $44,000 and have hit $13,000 already.

The watch is a little curvy for my taste but it looks like it wears well and, thanks to a huge crown, screw-down bars, and a hefty bracelet, you probably could run over this with a light truck and still wear it to prom. At $400 for a quartz and $549 for an ETA automatic movement you’re not looking at too much dosh and as long as you like the design you’re golden.

The watch will ship in December 2016.
