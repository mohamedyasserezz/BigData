In a blog post, Coursera co-founder Daphne Kollerannounced she is leavingthe company to join Alphabet subsidiary Calico.

Koller founded Coursera with Andrew Ng back in 2012 after working together on artificial intelligence research at Stanford. The two supported the company’s growth until Ng left to become chief scientist at Baidu’s research arm.  Today Coursera has grown to teach 20 million students material from 1,300 courses.
