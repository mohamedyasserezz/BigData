NASA just posted a treasure trove of Mars images

A total of 1,035 images to be exact – taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been doing its thing for a decade now. Every month, the JPL-managed spacecraft dutifully sends back images of the red planet, alongside a handful of fellow Mars-orbiting space crafts.

AsPopular Science points out, every 26 months or so, the MRO transmits a massive payload of shots from the planet’s surface, thanks the ideal positioning of Mars, Earth and the Sun. The result is a few weeks of stellar communications between the vessel and its home base, coupled and a really well-lit planetary surface.

Such highly detailed shots offer a lot of insight into the Martian landscape and could, perhaps, help facilitate future exploration. And, of course, they make for some really gorgeous glamor photos of our close — but still mysterious – next door neighbor.
