The TC Meetup + Pitch-off in Seoul goes down in one week! Buy tickets now!

In less than a week, TechCrunch is packing up and flying to Seoul, South Korea to get acquainted with one of the world’s biggest and brightest tech scenes. And we’re bringing theTC Meetup + Pitch-offwith us, so get excited!

Ten local startups will have exactly 60 seconds on stage to present their product to the audience and a panel of expert judges, including local VCs and TC editors. Judges will then deliberate on a winner, and three of those 10 startups will walk away with tickets to the next TC Disrupt conference.

But even if you’re not an entrepreneur looking to present, the event will still be loaded with awesome content (including panels with local tech celebs) and there will be plenty of time for networking before and after the on-stage program.

But tickets are selling out fast and I want to meetallof you.

So if you’re interested in hanging out with TC, meeting your local tech scene, and learning about the latest startups in Seoul, you should most definitelyhead over here and buy a ticket.

Applications to the pitch-off are closed, but we’ll be announcing the 10 participating startups and the members of the judging panel very soon.

Until then, head over to theevent pageand see if this is something you want to be a part of. (Spoiler alert: It is.)

See you soon!
