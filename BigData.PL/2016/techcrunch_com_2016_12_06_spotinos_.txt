Sonos Spotify app support is now live for all

Just over a month aftermaking it availableto a select number of users through public beta, long-awaited third-party app support for Spotify isofficially official.

The feature, which was first announced in August, brings the native Spotify experience to the streaming music hardware – a much requested feature in light of the somewhat awkward work around that accessed the music library by way of the Sonos app.

The move marks a key step in Sonos’ plan to offer more third-party integration, slowly but surely, having previously opened up Google Play Music and announced forthcoming support for Pandora. The new-found integration means that Spotify Premium subscribers can access the hardware via Spotify Connect, utilizing multiroom functionality and picking up where a track left off on mobile or other streaming devices.

The Sonos app will keep up with the music, as well, showing what’s playing and allowing control over what’s playing through Spotify.
