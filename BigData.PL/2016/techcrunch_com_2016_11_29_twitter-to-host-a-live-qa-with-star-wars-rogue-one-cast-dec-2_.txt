Twitter to host a live Q&A with Star Wars: Rogue One cast Dec. 2

Twitter is doing a live streaming event on Friday, December 2 with the cast ofRogue One: A Star Wars Story, the company announced today. The stream will be hosted byPeoplemagazine, and will include content from the film that hasn’t yet been released, as well as a question-and-answer segment fielding queries from Twitter users. The event kicks off at 10 AM PT (1 PM ET).

The Q&A will be broadcast from a “surprise location,” according to Twitter, and will be available on Twitter’s apps, and at RogueOne.twitter.com, as well as through the StarWars and People official Twitter accounts. Participants in the discussion will include Director Gareth Edwards, Lucasfilm President and Producer Kathleen Kennedy, along with cast members including Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Donnie Yen, Mads Mikkelsen, Alan Tudyk and Riz Ahmed.

This will probably be the penultimate hype moment for Rogue One prior to its December 16 release, so it might well be the last chance to see anything new about the upcoming film before its broadcast.

Twitter’s positioning itself as a key platform for special live events like this one, and the network is in a great position to know what kinds of events are going to resonate best with its audience. It’s no surprise that Star Wars is among those interests.
