Adweekis changing owners again.

The ad- and media-focused industry magazine is being sold byMediaBistro Holdingsto private equity firmBeringer Capital, with Beringer co-founder Brian F. Martin becoming Adweek’s chairman.

This followslast year’s spin outof Adweek and other media properties from Guggenheim Partners/Prometheus Global.

An Adweek spokesperson told me that nothing should be changing for the editorial team, with Editorial Director James Cooper (pictured above) remaining in charge. (I worked at Adweek, under Cooper, before I joined TechCrunch.)

“The digital landscape is ever-evolving, and it’ll be exciting to work with a partner who shares our passion for the future of media,” Cooper said inthe acquisition release.

Founded in 1978, Adweek says it now reaches more than 6.5 million unique visitors each month. The nine blogs in the Adweek Blog Network — including FishbowlNY, GalleyCat and PRNewser — are part of the deal.

Financial terms were not disclosed.
