Pokémon Sun and Moon break 3DS records with 10M units shipped globally

Nintendo’s Sun and Moon sequels in the popular Pokémon franchise have handily beat 3DS game sales records and past Pokémon launch performance, beating previous entries X and Y by 150 percent. Overall, Sun and Moon shipped over 10 million units globally, which make them the best-selling 3DS games in the portable console’s history.

How did Pokémon Sun and Moon outperform their predecessors so handily? Well the franchise always manages to pick up a few new fans, but this time it probably benefited from the Pokémon GO bump, or a spike in interest based on the introduction of the series to people unfamiliar with Pokémon from GO’s massively successful global mobile launch.

Niantic’s Pokémon GO isn’t a core part of the Pokémon series, and the gameplay for that AR app-based game is very different from what you get with the console versions. But a lot of people who’d never played Pokémon before did play Pokémon GO, judging by its peak download and activity numbers.

Of course, it helps that the game itself isactually a terrific entry in the franchise, with some major gameplay tweaks that mark the biggest changes to core mechanics the series has ever seen — the vast majority of which lead to improved gameplay.
