Apple just dropped iOS 10 beta 7 for developers and public testers

Apple keeps releasing new iOS 10 betas ahead of the final iOS 10 release in September. The company just issued the seventh beta for both developers and public beta testers — the public beta’s version number is one digit behind, so it’s public beta 6, but it’s the same version. Head over to the Settings app of your iPhone or iPad to update. There’s no sign of macOS, watchOS or tvOS updates, so it’s unclear whether Apple also plans to update these betas today.

While things are starting to look good, there are still some bugs at this stage, so I wouldn’t recommend installing it on your main phone just yet. You don’t want to risk having your phone become useless.

What’s new in iOS 10 exactly? The upcoming operating system features a massive Siri update with third-party integrations. While it’s going to be hard to see the end result during the beta because third-party developers haven’t released iOS 10 apps yet, it could have a big impact on the way you use your iPhone.

Apple has also unveiled a completely redesigned lock screen with rich notifications that can display tiny live widgets and a huge Photos app update with face recognition, deep learning categorization and intelligent photo albums. Apple Maps, Apple Music, HomeKit and the Phone app are also receiving updates. Finally, the company is overhauling the Messages app with many, many new features — an emojify feature, message effects, Slack-like feedback on messages, rich link previews and third-party extensions.

If Apple follows the same pattern as in previous years, we’re still a few weeks away from the final release. If you can’t wait and want to see what it looks like, I wrotea previewif you don’t have a non-essential iPhone or iPad lying around.
