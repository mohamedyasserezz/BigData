Facebook Events app comes to Android

Facebook’s standalone Events appthat launched in October on iOS islaunching on Android today. The Facebook Events app helps you browse nearby happenings, see the dates of your upcoming Facebook Events as well as imported calendars and aggregates wall posts and alerts from Events to declutter your main app’s notifications.

The Events app hasn’t proven too popular on iOS, oscillating between No. 250 and No. 500 on the U.S. social networking apps chart, according to App Annie. But massive usage was never the goal. The app is designed to help Facebook’s extroverts and event promoters better discover and manage events. That trickles down to a better experience for everyone else as these users invite friends to events using Facebook.

If Facebook can boost overall usage of its Events feature, no matter how people get to it, it could solidify one of its biggest differentiators versus competitors. No other social app has a vibrant events community, while event platforms like Eventbrite lack full-fledged social features. Plus, if Facebook can demonstrate that it’s the go-to place to discover what’s going on locally, it could attract more ad dollars from event promoters.
