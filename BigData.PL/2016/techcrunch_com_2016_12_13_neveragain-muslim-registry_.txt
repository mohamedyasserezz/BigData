Tech companies should probably come out against a Muslim registry now

With the Trump administration looming a hazy, ominous shade of toxic creamsicle orange on the horizon, some in tech arelining up single file. Others won’t go so quietly, especially when it comes to the apparently hyperpartisan issue of facilitating genocide.

After The Intercept’s Sam Biddleasked tech companiesif they would provide data for a hypothetical but not likethathypotheticalMuslim registry, most companies projected the special sort of loud silence that only an unanswered PR inquiry generates. (Notably, Twitter said no.) Now, a handful of employees at major tech companies aresigning onto a pledgelaunched by former Googler Ka-Ping Yee and Slack’s Leigh Honeywell.

Anyone who signs theneveragain.tech pledgecommits to the following:

We refuse to participate in the creation of databases of identifying information for the United States government to target individuals based on race, religion, or national origin.

We will advocate within our organizations:

– to minimize the collection and retention of data that would facilitate ethnic or religious targeting.– toscale back existing datasetswith unnecessary racial, ethnic, and national origin data.– to responsibly destroy high-risk datasets and backups.– to implement security and privacy best practices, in particular, forend-to-end encryptionto be the default wherever possible.– to demand appropriate legal process should the government request that we turn over user data collected by our organization, even in small amounts.

If we discover misuse of data that we consider illegal or unethical in our organizations:

– We will work with our colleagues and leaders to correct it.– If we cannot stop these practices,we will exercise our rights and responsibilities to speak out publicly and engage in responsible whistleblowingwithout endangering users.– If we have the authority to do so, we will use all available legal defenses to stop these practices.–If we do not have such authority, and our organizations force us to engage in such misuse, we will resign from our positions rather than comply.

We will raise awareness and ask critical questions about the responsible and fair use of data and algorithms beyond our organization and our industry.

Beyond the names on the current list, we’re sure that many more tech workers are deeply opposed to some the more alarming machinations of the Trump administration than they’ll let on. Most are likely waiting for their top brass to take a company-wide stance, lest they be scolded or even fired for breaking rank.

Of course, Silicon Valley is a traditional bastion of Bay Area liberalism until those values become at odds with its bottom line. (Indeed, tech loves pretending that Peter Thiel is an abberation rather than a homegrown organic, grass-fed monster person!) We doubt that many of tech’s major data players will be willing to commit to some of the specifics here, like data destruction, end-to-end encryption and de-identifying future demographic data, but the pledge does apply more pressure for companies to come out with a statement on their own terms.

We refuse to assist the US gov in mass deportation & religious targeting. Join us. Sign the pledge athttps://t.co/U6PdhpQqox

While this is all still hypothetical and preventative, the reality of a Muslim registry analogous to the Jewish registries that made the Holocaust so darkly efficient would not be difficult to procure. Between social networks and targeted advertising, tech companies command a nearly boundless well of personal demographic information on their users.

Even if users opt to not disclose their own race/religion/sexuality or other identifying details, search histories and social network data could piece the identity puzzle together easily, at scale. There’s no doubt that the information exists—and users are rightfully nervous about it—but what tech companies will do and say remains, unlike everything else, unknowable.
