Mobile marketing and data startup mParticle raises $17.5M

mParticleannounced today that it has raised $17.5 million in Series B funding.

The New York City startup helps marketers collect user data through a variety of services and then funnel that data to other marketing and analytics tools. Co-founder and CEO Michael Katz said this not only reduces integration challenges and technical difficulties, but also helps businesses get a more unified view of their customers.

Contrasting mParticle with existing tag management and data management companies, Katz added, “Now we’re in this era where consumers are interacting with brands in very much a multi-screen format. And it’s mobile first, and it’s app centric. The tools that were brought to market yesterday to solve for the challenges then just don’t work very well or at all in these multi-screen app environments.”

The Series B was led by Bain Capital Ventures, with participation from Social Capital (whichled the $15 million Series Athat mParticle announced at the beginning of this year).

The company says it’s managing data on more than 1 billion mobile users each month, with new customers that include Jet, Hulu, Foursquare, Postmates and Chick-Fil-A.
