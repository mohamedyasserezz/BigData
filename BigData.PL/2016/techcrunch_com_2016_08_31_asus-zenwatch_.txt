ASUS goes round for the latest ZenWatch

This year’s IFA is certain to be another giant event for wearable launches, but only one company can be the first. Keep in mind, we’re still a few days out from the official kickoff event of the giant consumer electronics event here in Berlin, but the press events have already hit full force.

ASUS took to the stage today, just after Acer wrapped up, in a bit of alphabetical serendipity, showing off the latest addition to the company’s Android Wear line. The ZenWatch 3 sports a 1.39-inch display with a 400 x 400 resolution that clocks in at 287ppi. It’s also round, which marks a departure from its predecessor’s chunky square design.

The 9.95mm thick smartwatch features an upgraded stainless steel design with three large buttons on the side of the bezel, which provide, among other things, quick access to the company’s proprietary fitness app, ZenFit. From the looks of it, the hardware is an all-around upgrade for the last generation.

The new ZenWatch features a waterproof rating of IP67, which means it’ll work after being submerged in a meter of water for up to 30 minutes. ASUS has also included the new Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and HyperCharge technology, which promises to fill the battery 60 percent after five minutes. It should also get around two days on a full charge.

It should run around $255 when it hits the States next month.
